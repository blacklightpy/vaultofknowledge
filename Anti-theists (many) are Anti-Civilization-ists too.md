They start by equating problems of religions to all religions.

But if we were to point out the differences, we would notice that it is complicated.

But if we were to spend effort to describe the differences, it would be complex, and they would say it is mental gymnastics. In fact, even if it is simple, if it's a few paragraphs so that they don't misrepresent it, they would say that they are busy and they need short answers. If it's short enough, they would do their best to pretend to not see it. And also, if you make it short by omitting details, they would misrepresent it.

The thing is, life is inherently complicated. And when one attempts to describe it, the anti-theists would accuse you of trying to make it more complicated.

But any civilization requires understanding various perspectives and ensuring everyone lives together in peace. And that requires explaining everyone's perspectives. If it isn't done well, some people will be left out.

So, in the absence of a complex description, what they want is for everyone to realize that there is no law. They want society to be one where everyone can do whatever they want, with rights forming from alliances.

But they do not realize that this is exactly what has happened. When people form alliances, the fact that many people believe in God also gets taken into account. If atheists were any smart as they claim to be, they would also realize that by their own definition, most people are not smart, and they cannot exert force to control what everyone else thinks, when they can't even control an earthquake or tsunami.

Basically, they try to focus on what they can, and avoid focusing on what they cannot control. But then they are working on an unstable ground. Their only guarantee is the fact that they observe natural laws to be consistent. But the consistency of natural laws does not at all mean that natural phenomena will be predictable, because we simply do not know enough to predict it. And even if we try to find everything and succeed, we would only be removing the chance for any miracle - and to qualify that - any law or phenomena we failed to look into - to occur. However, I state that, with also the observable guarantee, that there will always be something beyond our knowledge. If the universe exists, it, by that fact, implies some grounds for its existence - and you can also not know anything about that ground unless you had a direct link to it.

But consciousness is one requirement for a world to exist, so
