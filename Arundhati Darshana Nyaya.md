I'm making a note about this Nyaya specifically, because I had tried to make a Wiki page for it, to complete the topic on Adhikari Bheda, and it was found to not be notable.

## As Sthula / Sthoola Arundhathi Nyaaya:
### Reference 1

### Reference 2
https://vidyabalaji.wordpress.com/bhagavad-gita/bhagavad-gita-chapter-3/ (BG 3.1-2):

> Better explained through: Sthool-Arundhati-Nyaya refers to pointing to a very tiny star Arundhati through the help of a bigger star in its neighbourhood. Being tiny, Arundhati cannot be immediately identified by the one who is trying to see
it. Therefore, the teacher first shows a big star which is there in its neighbourhood. And then shows the tiny star from there which can then be recognized.

Book provided: Nyayavali by Pandit Narinder Sharma  (doesn't list Arundhati Nyaya) - AH Yes! It is 233. स्थूलारुन्धतीन्याय (Sthoola Arundhati Nyaya)

But then, there's also 395 from a seemingly later version here: https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/nyaayaavalii.html
## As Arundhati Darshana Nyaaya:

### Reference 1
http://www.advaidam.com/2017/11/13/taitreya-upanishad-class-26 (Taitreya Up 2.1.4):
> This gradual journey of the mind is achieved through Pancha Kosha Prakriya also known as Arundhati Darshanam Nyayaha.

(i.e realizing you are not each Kosha)
