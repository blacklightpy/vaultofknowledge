The Veda·s may align completely with my views. Yet, I do not consider it authoritative. In that sense, I cannot be considered Naasthika or Aasthika. Because until I know it, I may be Aasthika.

But as far as I do not know what it says, I cannot consider it authoritative. Because I do not believe without knowing.

I could be Naasthika in the sense that I do not give an infallible authority to the Veda·s before reading it. I refuse to hold something authoritative because it is traditional.
