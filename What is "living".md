One often hears of two things (1) the "life is change" and (2) the "living word of God." Now, that would imply that the word of God changes with time. But a specific connotation given to the word of God is that it is "unchanging."

If so, how can that be considered "living"? It is living in the sense that it outlines the laws of reality. But if so, it should have both a changing and an unchanging component. Now, only the unchanging component is taught to be necessary to us. However, specific codifications of this unchanging word can be said to be contradicting the changing word, making people consider what's natural a problem that one must stop by making it adher to the limits of their version of the unchanging word.

This is why in Indian religions, we teach both the "unchanging" (or static) and "changing" (or dynamic) aspects of Eeshvara. This is implemented in the Aagama-Thanthra traditions, where the Aagama guide one to the unchanging aspect of Eeshvara, and the Thanthra guides one to the changing aspect of Eeshvara.
