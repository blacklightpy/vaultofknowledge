(1) We know science, and (2) therefore we know religion is wrong. (3) Israel is a state of the Jews, and (4) therefore they are foolish, and (5) so are the Muhammadians, and so (6) this war is a case of fools fighting fools. But since (7) just because people are fools, (8) we the intelligent people should not let them kill each other, and (9) among these fools, there are non-foolish people just like us, and they get affected by war.

So basically, their entire support of Muhammadians is based on the notion that they are fools, and that they (the leftists) are the non-foolish intellectuals who are able to teach them that war is meaningless and God is an illusion. This is a total disrespect of Muhammadian beliefs, and being self-delusive people, the left does not understand that no Muhammadian who believes would ever be convinced by their idea of materialism.

[A leftist who disagrees with what I said may raise their hands, and I'll be more than happy to correct my views where they are wrong. If you as much as think this is a distortion, raise your hands.]

I make this statement as a person who holds the view that there is a non-material cause to the material world, through direct experience as well as by rational means; while also being someone who previously was an agnostic skeptic who tried to find a materialistic explanation for the material reality.

A materialist would not hold my view, because from their perspective, the Muhammadian is a deluded fool. But from a non-materialist perspective like the one I hold, the Muhammadian is a person who is convinced that his Deen of submission is the most accurate explanation of the non-material origin of reality. My opposition of their religion is simply based on my own direct experience of this reality, and by the rational means, by which I disagree with (1) some nuances of their theology, and (2) most of their laws and customs applicable within the material world which they justify on the basis of the former.


But in doing this, they ignore two things:

(1) Israel is a secular state built for the people who are Jewish by ethnicity, and not just by faith.
(2) This left does not know how to understand history, and thinks truth is the majority opinion (and by that logic, the Muslims should always be right since there are 2 billion of them compared to 15 million Jews).

Additionally, there are two more things:

(3) Jews have 163 times the amount of Nobel Prizes per population compared to the atheists (so much for Jews being the religious fools).
(4) While Israel provides human rights under Enlightenment Age values for all people including Muhammadians, all Muhammadian nations refuse to provide the same right for anyone, including Muhammadians themselves.
