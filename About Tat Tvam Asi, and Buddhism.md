When Shvethakethu was told "that and you are alike," when he looked at the inside of the fruit, what we need to understand is that within each things, there is emptiness.

However, when you look at empty space, though it has no matter (or gas or energy for that matter), it has God. This is the main difference we have with Buddhists.
