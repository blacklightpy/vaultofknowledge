Markdown Editor -> Markdown -> HTML Builder -> HTML -> HTML Editor -> Publish

```mermaid
graph LR
A["Markdown Editor"] --> B["Markdown"] --> C["HTML Builder"] --> D["HTML"] --> E["HTML Editor"] --> F["Publish"]
```

Or basically just an editor that can switch between Markdown and HTML modes like Publisher used to be able to. There are many WSIWYG editors on GitHub, like Jodit.
