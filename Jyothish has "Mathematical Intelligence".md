My cousin told me this, and there's a story behind it. But I disagree with this claim.

Intelligence, Knowledge and Inclination.

They confuse my perseverance and will-power for intelligence.

This is a dangerous way of thinking, because they will from there assume that I'm egoistic. My batchmates and other people from my school have done this. And I believe they've done this because the school has a military culture, and that's what they expect from everyone, while I was someone who did not share that culture, and only had a technical mindset. I've specifically seen people who were friendly to me earlier start hating me quickly after I tried to break down complex topics in an ELI5 level, because they saw me as someone who was flaunting my intellect. I've only tried to help them, and they would start hating me for it.

Now this is not too strange for a world where arranged marriages are considered moral and love marriages are considered immoral, and how being born as homosexual and living in accordance with that is considered immoral or being born transgender or mixed-gender is considered cursed, but killing homosexuals is considered moral.
