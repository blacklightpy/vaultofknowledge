About programming. Programming basically lets you make use of the abilities of what's non-material, by utilizing the laws of physics. You are able to arrange them in order because you have a will, by which you assign a behaviour or minimal will to it.

If it is a mechanical device, the will is more minimal than if it was an automated device, and the will is more when it is a form of artificial intelligence. The complexity of behavioural rules is what makes it intelligent, but that alone doesn't make it so, because a complex device can still be non-intelligent. It is the ability to analyze and react to new information in complex ways that makes it intelligent.

Therefore, the generation of AI is simply when a designer applies his will to impart a will on to the device through material means, and then forgets or simply ignores the details of its working. This is because if he did not ignore the details of its working, he would simply see it as a mechanical system.

In the same way, the generation of intelligent life is only possible when an intelligent creator

This is the case in Kashmir Shaivism, where Shiva imposes on himself 5 Kanchukas (or veils)
