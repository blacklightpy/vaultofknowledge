It is not by prior knowledge alone, but by intuition.

For example, on how I know about the "Where is my Train app."

I do not know of it because I've been told there is such an app, I simply intuited it's existence from knowing that the train's position can be tracked, and there is a way for such an app to exist.

That is, not all knowledge is discovered by random occurences and documented from there.
