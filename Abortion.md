## Shruthi



**Bhagavad Geetha, Chapter 18:**

> 47] Faulty Swa-Dharma (self tendency) is better than well performed Para-Dharma (other's tendency); Naturally prescribed performance of Karma never achieves sinful reactions.
> 
> 48] O son of Kunti, trivial(natural) Karma should never be given up, even though [it is] faulty; All initiations [of Karma] are faulty, like how smoke covers the fire.

> 
> 16] If all the members of the foetus are complete, or if it be observed to have consciousness, or fully developed in its limbs, large and small — then the sinner must perform twice the penance for killing a cow.

**Sathya Sai Baba on Journey to God: Part II, Page 88 (Referenced from Page 1, Section "Abortion" of A Compendium of the Teachings of Sri Sathya Sai Baba):**

> When asked the question, “When does the soul enter the body?”, Swami replied, “The soul enters the body on or after the fifth month.” When asked about abortion after the fifth month, He answered: “No abortion!”. When asked about abortion before the fifth month, Swami said, “No! No! Even before - abortion is bad... Mind control... Use mind control."

My criticism: He has said that no one should question anyone's faith because it hurts their feelings and it cannot be repaired. I call it bullshit. It is naive and naivety is dangerous. Likewise, here too, he speaks on the basis of feelings.

**Osho:**

[[Osho on Abortion]]. He nailed this part haha.

**Prabhupada, in Hare Krishna Explosion by Hayagriva Das, Chapter 3:**

> Abortion, birth control: “They are killing the baby in the womb. How cruel! In this age of unwanted population, man is losing his compassion. When you kill a living entity, even an ant, you are interfering with its spiritual evolution, its progress. That living entity must again take on that same life form to complete its designated life term in that body. And the killer must return to pay for damages.…
