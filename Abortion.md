Parashara Smrithi:

> What sin is incurred in killing a Brahman, abortion causes a sin twice as great ; there is no atonement for that sin. The abandonment of such a woman has been ordained by law.

> If all the members of the foetus are complete, or if it be observed to have consciousness, or fully developed in its limbs, large and small â€” then the sinner must perform twice the penance for killing a cow.

Vishnu Puraana Book II, Chapter 6:

> He who causes abortion, plunders a town, kills a cow, or strangles a man, goes to the Rodha hell (or that of obstruction).
