**Vishnu Puraana Book 2, Chapter 6:**

> Parashara said:
> 
> He who causes abortion, plunders a town, kills a cow, or strangles a man, goes to the Rodha hell (or that of obstruction).

**Parashara Smrithi Chapter 4:**

> 20] What sin is incurred in killing a Brahman, abortion causes a sin twice as great; there is no atonement for that sin. The abandonment of such a woman has been ordained by law.

**Parashara Smrithi Chapter 9:**

> 13]  If the foetus of a cow is destroyed, while it is in an amorphous state, a quarter penance is prescribed for the sin; when it has attained some distinct form, then the penance should be two quarters ; by destroying a foetus which has not yet developed its consciousness, the sinner must perform three quarters.
> 
> 16] If all the members of the foetus are complete, or if it be observed to have consciousness, or fully developed in its limbs, large and small — then the sinner must perform twice the penance for killing a cow.
> 
> (i.e. killing a complete unborn calf is twice as sinful as killing a born cow).

**Gautama Dharma Soothra, Chapter 12:**

> 4] To be an outcast means to be deprived of the right to follow the lawful occupations of twice-born men.

**Manu Smrithi, Chapter 5:**

> 89] Libations of water shall not be offered to..
> 
> 90] To women who have joined a heretical sect, who through lust live (with many men), who have caused an abortion, have killed their husbands, or drink spirituous liquor.

**Garuda Puraana Book 1 (Agasthya Samhitha), Chapter 105 (Prayaschitta):**

> Yaanjavalkya said:
> 
> 23] The sin which is incidental to bringing about the abortion of a pregnant woman, may be expiated by doing a penance which is laid down in respect of an act of destroying a fœtus or a child of the same caste.
> 
> 48] Wilful miscarriage of a foetus, and speaking ill of her husband, are the acts which degrade a woman, whose very presence should be shunned from a distance.
> 
> **Another translation without basis:**
> 48] Willful abortion and hatred of the husband are great sins in women without any expiation.

>  She, who wilfully brings; about an abortion, except for the purposes of purifying herself after having committed an act of adultery, commits the sin of killing her own husband born in her womb in the shape of the fœtus. Polluted is the person of such a murderess.

**Sathya Sai Baba on Journey to God: Part II, Page 88 (Referenced from Page 1, Section "Abortion" of A Compendium of the Teachings of Sri Sathya Sai Baba):**

> When asked the question, “When does the soul enter the body?”, Swami replied, “The soul enters the body on or after the fifth month.” When asked about abortion after the fifth month, He answered: “No abortion!”. When asked about abortion before the fifth month, Swami said, “No! No! Even before - abortion is bad... Mind control... Use mind control."

My criticism: He has said that no one should question anyone's faith because it hurts their feelings and it cannot be repaired. I call it bullshit. It is naive and naivety is dangerous. Likewise, here too, he speaks on the basis of feelings.

**Osho:**

[[Osho on Abortion]]. He nailed this part haha.

**Prabhupada, in Hare Krishna Explosion by Hayagriva Das, Chapter 3:**

> Abortion, birth control: “They are killing the baby in the womb. How cruel! In this age of unwanted population, man is losing his compassion. When you kill a living entity, even an ant, you are interfering with its spiritual evolution, its progress. That living entity must again take on that same life form to complete its designated life term in that body. And the killer must return to pay for damages.…
