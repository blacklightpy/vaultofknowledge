So Abu Basir said Muhammad fulfilled the terms since he sent him back, and he defended himself by his religion to avoid being seduced to their religion or being scoffed at. And he settled at al-'Is. And hearing this, other Muhammadians followed him there, and started attacking Qurayshi caravans. So Quraysh decided they have no use for these Muhammadians, and told Muhammad to take them in his custody and stop them.

> Then Abu Basir went off until he halted at al-'Is in the region of Dhuâ€™lMarwa by the sea-shore on the road which Quraysh were accustomed to take to Syria. The Muslims who were confined in Mecca heard what the apostle had said of Abu Basir so they went out to join him in al-'Is. About seventy men attached themselves to him, and they so harried Quraysh, killing everyone they could get hold of and cutting to pieces every caravan that passed them, that Quraysh wrote to the apostle begging him by the 753 ties of kinship to take these men in, for they had no use for them; so the apostle took them in and they came to him in Medina (755).
