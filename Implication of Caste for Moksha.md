I saw on one example that Mantras acquired without permission are not useful. But then, who can acquire Mantras via Deeksha? I wondered if Kshoodras were permitted.

# Cases from Shruthi
## Initiation of Satyakaama Jaabaala
The 4th Prapaathaka (Chapter) of Chandogya Upanishad deals with a boy named Satyakaama Jaabaala, who is of unknown lineage since his mother was a prostitute, but was accepted as a Braahmana based on his honesty.
### Objections and my Dismissals
Now some people do interpret this to mean that the Guru realized that he was born to a Braahmana. But his mother was a Kshoodra, and the son of a Kshoodra and a Braahmana is a Chandaala as per the Dharma Shaasthras.

And secondly, the same people point out that this is how Parashuraama found Karna to be a Kshathriya. But then, seeing one's qualities does not imply that it should come only through the "bloodline." This is an ancient mistake, which is disproven by current social awareness.

### Special Objection: Brahma Soothras
The Brahma Soothras have a section dealing with the possibility of initiation of Shoodras

> **Brahma Soothras, Adhyaaya I, Pada 3, Adhikarana 9 (Soothras 34-38):**
> 
> शुगस्य तदनादरश्रवणात्तदाद्रवणात्सूच्यते हि ॥ ३४॥
> क्षत्रियत्वागतेश्चोत्तरत्र चैत्ररथेन लिङ्गात् ॥ ३५॥
> संस्कारपरामर्शात्तदभावाभिलापाच्च ॥ ३६॥
> तदभावनिर्धारणे च प्रवृत्तेः ॥ ३७॥
> श्रवणाध्ययनार्थप्रतिषेधात् स्मृतेश्च ॥ ३८॥


The source is in Chandogya Upanishad IV.4.3-5.

Swaami Vivekaananda also criticized Shankara Aachaarya for enforcing caste.
