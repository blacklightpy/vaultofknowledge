I saw on one example that Mantras acquired without permission are not useful. But then, who can acquire Mantras via Deeksha? I wondered if Shoodras were permitted.
# Cases from Shruthi
## Initiation of Satyakaama Jaabaala
The 4th Prapaathaka (Chapter) of Chandogya Upanishad deals with a boy named Satyakaama Jaabaala, who is of unknown lineage since his mother was a prostitute, but was accepted as a Braahmana based on his honesty.
### Objections and my Dismissals
Now some people do interpret this to mean that the Guru realized that he was born to a Braahmana. But his mother was a Kshoodra, and the son of a Kshoodra and a Braahmana is a Chandaala as per the Dharma Shaasthras.

And secondly, the same people point out that this is how Parashuraama found Karna to be a Kshathriya. But then, seeing one's qualities does not imply that it should come only through the "bloodline." This is an ancient mistake, which is disproven by current social awareness.
### Special Objection: Brahma Soothras
The Brahma Soothras have a section dealing with the possibility of initiation of Shoodras

> **Brahma Soothras, Adhyaaya I, Pada 3, Adhikarana 9 (Soothras 34-38):**
> 
> शुगस्य तदनादरश्रवणात्तदाद्रवणात्सूच्यते हि ॥ ३४॥
> क्षत्रियत्वागतेश्चोत्तरत्र चैत्ररथेन लिङ्गात् ॥ ३५॥
> संस्कारपरामर्शात्तदभावाभिलापाच्च ॥ ३६॥
> तदभावनिर्धारणे च प्रवृत्तेः ॥ ३७॥
> श्रवणाध्ययनार्थप्रतिषेधात् स्मृतेश्च ॥ ३८॥

The original story referred in the Soothras is in Chandogya Upanishad IV.4.3-5.

> **Translation:**
> 
> Satyakāma went to Gautama, the son of Haridrumata, and said: ‘Revered sir, I wish to live with you as a celibate. I have come, revered sir, to be your disciple’.
> 
> Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla’.
> 
> Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. [Therefore, you must be a brāhmin.] O Somya, go and get me some fuel [for the sacrificial fire]. I will initiate you [as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread], as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away [and look after them].’ As Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.

Swaami Vivekaananda also criticized Shankara Aachaarya for enforcing caste. Since it's lengthy, I moved it to a separate note, [[Swami Vivekananda's criticism of Shankara Aachaarya|here]].

Also, what about adopted children? Adopted children in myths are treated as of the same Varna.
