About "Hindu": i.e. the identity isn't a real one like the Abrahamics. In fact, one definition is that it refers to the beliefs of all people in India. / So it is unfair to say that only traditional devotees of Ayyappa can have a say in it. That's just a way to justify the mob mindset.

About Isaivani: Criticized Ayyappa, but wrote hymns for Jesus.
