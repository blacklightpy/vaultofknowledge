### Historical Evolution
- Apostolic Age (focused on house churches and informal gatherings)
- Post-Constantinian Era (dioceses and provinces were formalized to reflect the structure of the Roman Empire)
- Protestant Reformation (simplification of church structures in many denominations like Congregational and Presbyterian)
### Church Denominational Structures
- Congregationalist Structure (independent and self-governing / Baptist, Pentecostal, Evangelical)
- Episcopal Structure (hierarchical, with bishops governing dioceses / Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox)
- Presbyterian Structure (governed by elders (presbyters) in a representative system / Reformed, Presbyterian)
- Synodal Structure (governed by councils or synods, often shared between clergy and laity / Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestant)
### Church Organizational Structures
- Local and Congregational
	- Church (building and community, generally serves a parish or community)
	- Parish (smallest ecclesiastical division, often a single congregation / led by a parish priest or pastor)
	- Mission (a church or community in a region that's expanding in Christianity / often associated with evangelization)
- Regional and Jurisdictional Levels
	- Diocese (geographical district with multiple parishes / governed by a bishop in Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox Traditions)
		- Metropolitan See (the primary diocese within an ecclesiastical province / governed by a metropolitan archbishop)
	- Eparchy (same as diocese / governed by an eparch in Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches)
	- Deanery (subdivision within a diocese or eparchy, with a group of parishes / led by a dean)
	- Vicariate (a district within a diocese or mission territory / often under the care of a vicar or missionary bishop)
	- Province / Ecclesiastical Province (a cluster of dioceses or eparchies grouped together / led by an archbishop or metropolitan, who oversees the primary diocese (archdiocese))
	- Patriarchate (a jurisdiction of major significance / often led by a patriarch in Eastern Orthodoxy, Eastern Catholicism and Oriental Orthodoxy)
	- Exarchate (a jurisdiction for missionary regions not yet organized into dioceses / Eastern Catholic, Orthodox)
	- Prelature (a church jurisdiction (not necessarily tied to a geographical area) under the oversight of a prelate (bishop or archbishop))
		- Personal Prelature (serve by circumstance rather than geography)
	- Ordinariate (a structure created to serve specific groups of faithful within a broader church, often with unique liturgical (pubic service or worship) or cultural needs)
		- Military Ordinariate (serves members of the armed forces)
	- Titular See (a diocese that no longer has a resident bishop due to historical reasons, but is retained as a honorary title for bishops)
- Global and Supra-Regional Levels
	- Autocephalous Church (self-governing church / in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy)
	- Holy See (jurisdiction of the Pope in the Catholic Church, in the Vatican City)
	- Synod (a council or assembly of bishops or church leaders governing a particular church or denomination)
### Special Church Buildings and Titles
- Church (building and community, generally serves a parish or community)
- Basilica (special designation given to certain churches by the Pope in the Catholic Church / can display the papal insignia)
	- Major Basilicas (Four basilicas in Rome)
	- Minor Basilicas (Everywhere else)
- Cathedral (principal church of a diocese, where the bishop's official chair (cathedra) is located)
- Pro-Cathedral (a temporary cathedral used until a permanent one is built)
- Chapel (smaller place of worship, associated with a school or hospital / not the center of a parish or diocese)
- Shrine (churches or sacred spaces with special significance, often linked to a saint, relic or miracle)
- Abbey (part of a monastery or convent / governed by an abbot or abbess)
- Oratory (a small place of prayer, but with the ability to hold public worship services)
- Minister (a church historically associated with monastic communities or missionary work)
- Collegiate Church (a church endowed with a college of canons or priests, but not designated as a cathedral)




- Some structures, like **military ordinariates** or **personal prelatures**, serve people based on circumstances rather than geography, adding a layer of complexity to church governance.
