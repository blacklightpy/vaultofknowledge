Ajit Vadakayil said there are no such words. But I know of at least one strong example.

> The word 'vṛtti' has multiple meanings: a modification of the antaḥ-karaṇa or avidyā as a thought; existence; livelihood; a function of prāṇa; a division of grammar; or a commentary on sūtra. The use of the word in this post is unrelated to any of these meanings.
