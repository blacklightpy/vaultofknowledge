Ajit Vadakayil said there are no such words. But I know of at least one strong example.

From Vichara Sagara (http://www.vicharasagara.com/2015/05/sakti-and-laksana-vrtti.html):

> The association between a word and its meaning is called 'vṛtti'.

> The word 'vṛtti' has multiple meanings: a modification of the antaḥ-karaṇa or avidyā as a thought; existence; livelihood; a function of prāṇa; a division of grammar; or a commentary on sūtra. The use of the word in this post is unrelated to any of these meanings.

I know this word from the notion of 'Chittha Vritthi Nirodha' in Yoga Soothras, and from, well, by similarity to the word vṛddhi, which I encountered while seeing how the PIE word \*deywos was derived from \*diw.
