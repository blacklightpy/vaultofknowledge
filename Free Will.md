Free will, as it is understood by beings of the dualistic world, does not apply to the ultimate reality.

The ultimate will is free, perfect and unchanging.

These three qualities are self-supporting and complete. For example, humans may have a desire to finish a task, but external realities may hinder them. But their will is to accomplish the task. If they were not affected by something external to them, their reality would have been in accordance with their will. A human desires something because they will it.

Then when the ultimate reality decides something, it doesn't have to think it over. Because thinking comes from a limited mind's perspective, where they need to consider more data. In that way, the ultimate will is unchanging.

For example, take the idea that Fourier Series equations can generate artworks. This is not a perfect analogy, but just consider equations that generate patterns at some areas, but they go on for infinity. A batman diagram or circle does not count, because they are cyclic.

All mathematical equations are unchanging, so when we use them as the models, we do not have to consider if they'll change, unless the equation we are using is a dependant equation (i.e. one that requires external input). But then we can plot the external inputs, but the point is that then the whole result would not be perfect. So if there is such an equation, we can just apply the constant and generate the specific equation.

A sine wave is cyclic and repeating. So if we consider the ultimate will to be like a sine wave, it accounts for perfection and unchangingness, but it is not free.

But if we take a function that generates some fancy phenomena at some interval, it still collapses towards the regions away from them. So if we consider the case of some fancy phenomena appearing in graphs, they still collapse towards infinity.
