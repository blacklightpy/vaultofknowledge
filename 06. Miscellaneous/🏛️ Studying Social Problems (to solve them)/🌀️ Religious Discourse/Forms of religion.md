	- e.g. Abrahamic religions
- Polytheism: Worship of many gods.
	- e.g. Egyptian Gods, Greek Gods
- Henotheism: Worship of one supreme god doesn't mean you can't have other gods.
	- e.g. Hinduism
- Animism: All entities possess a spiritual essence.
	- e.g. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism
- Pantheism: Reality itself is what we call god. It is distinct from Panentheism in that god is not distinct from the world.
	- e.g. Hinduism, Taoism, Sikhism, Confucianism
- Pantheistic Animism - The belief that all reality has a single soul and that is god.
	- e.g. Giordano Bruno's religion.
- Panentheism: God intersects every part of the universe and also extends beyond space and time. It is different from Pantheism in that god is a distinct quality from the world.
	- e.g. Hinduism (Advaita Vedanta, Achintya-Bheda-Abheda)
- Monistic Theism: A combination of Pantheism and Panentheism, but does not attribute personality to god. This is the core idea of Hinduism
- Substance monotheism: The belief that there are many different gods, but that they are all essentially forms of the same essence
