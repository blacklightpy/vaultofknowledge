> **Interviewer:** The earlier pope?
> 
> **Osho:** Yes, he was a bishop in Milan before becoming the pope, and the whole of Milan knew about it because he was continuously going around with a homosexual, a young man.
> 
> **Interviewer:** But that's purely a sexual preference.
> 
> **Osho:** That’s what I am saying – that it is perversion, not preference.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Osho,
> You mean a man like you, who believes in free sex, you would object to people exercising a sexual preference?
> 
> **Osho:** No, it is not a preference. Otherwise, soon you will be making love to the camera, making love to the electric pole. And please, don’t disturb my junipers! It is not preference, it is unnatural. This homosexuality is a religious contribution to humanity. It started in the monasteries, where only men were living and no woman was allowed in. It started in the nunneries, where only women were living and no man was allowed. Naturally, man is intelligent enough to find some way.
> 
> All the monks have been either masturbators or homosexuals, but in some way they have to do something. You cannot change their biology by just preaching. Their bodies won’t listen to your Bible.
> 
> **Interviewer:** But you were a celibate at twenty-one. Why can't they be?
> 
> **Osho:** I have never been a celibate.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Your _Bible_ says that.
> 
> **Osho:** I have never been a celibate. If people believe it, that is their foolishness. I have always loved women – and perhaps more women than anybody else. You can see my beard: it has become grey so quickly because I have lived so intensely that I have compressed almost two hundred years into fifty.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Of sexuality?
> 
> **Osho:** Yes. But I am not a homosexual. These people have been talking of celibacy, and creating sexual perversion. And the sexual perversion has led to the disease AIDS, which can kill almost two-thirds of humanity. Who will be responsible for it?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Osho,
> Where do you draw the line between sexual perversion and sexual experimentation?
> 
> **Osho:** There is no sexual experimentation. Sex is a purely biological thing, absolutely determined by biology. For example, in the wild no animal is homosexual. But in a zoo, if only male animals are there and no female is available, they turn into homosexuals. Your world is a zoo, not a wild place. In a wild jungle, nobody… No animal ever turns into a homosexual.

I disagree. Bonobos are homosexual. Clownfishes change gender.

> **Interviewer:** So would you, like Rousseau, talk in terms of going back to nature, to the wild?
> 
> **Osho:** No. I am not saying back to nature, I am saying forward to nature. Not back – back is not my vocabulary – _forward_ to nature. There are tremendous treasures hidden in nature, which these perverted people have denied humanity enjoying. I am against these people, because what they are saying and what they are doing ultimately results in something like a curse.
> 
> All the religions have been preaching celibacy, and nobody has ever bothered whether celibacy is medically possible or not. Even Mahatma Gandhi at the age of seventy was having wet dreams in the night. And you cannot find a more sincere man, trying more sincerely than he tried to be a celibate. For forty years, no success. And do you know, in the end he started sleeping with a naked woman? But Gandhians don’t talk about it.
> 
> Gandhians even approached Mahatma Gandhi, asking him, “Please don’t do it.” Vinoba was one of them, Kalelkar was another; Maulana Azad, Kripalani, all asked him, “Please don’t do this ‘experiment’” – in your language. It was not an “experiment”; it was forty years of failure of celibacy.
> 
> And all these popes… Just two days ago, a Christian minister was jailed for one and a half years because he was abusing small children. That is experimentation. In the pulpit, in the church, he is talking about celibacy, and inside the church he is abusing small children. One of the fathers filed the case, and he got one and a half years in jail. Now many others have come, because they were afraid to say anything against the religious leader, but now he is in jail, many other children have said that he has been doing the same with them.
> 
> But this is not just about one priest I am saying this: all the priests have to do it! We are forcing them to do it. We respect their celibacy, and that respect is a bribe to remain celibate. And their biology does not know about your respectability; their biology has its own laws and it follows its own laws.
> 
> The people who have been consoling the poor are the enemies of the poor. Poverty can be destroyed immediately. All that is needed is that nations should disappear – only then can wars disappear.
> 
> And seventy-five percent of every nation’s income is going into war efforts. America is even pouring eighty percent of its income into nuclear weapons. Now, if the whole world stops this nonsense, what is the need to be poor? We have so much energy, so much money, so much scientific intelligence.
> 
> But it is strange. In England, in Europe, in America too, they are destroying food – and Ethiopia is dying. And soon India will be in the same position. If you see Rajiv Gandhi, tell him that he will be responsible for India’s poverty and people dying there, because he is exporting wheat outside India, and his own people are on the verge of death – half the country. But he wants a nuclear plant. Tell him that this is not a child’s game, and he doesn’t understand anything about humanity. He had better go and become a pilot again, that is his place! He doesn’t understand, and he doesn’t need to be the prime minister of a country which is suffering from poverty – and he is looking to create a nuclear plant! For what?
> 
> Even if India puts every penny into creating nuclear weapons, it will take three hundred years for them to be equal in power to America or the Soviet Union. And do you think that for three hundred years, America and the Soviet Union will be staying where they are? It is stupid, absolutely stupid, for a country like India to think of nuclear weapons, atomic energy.
> 
> But they go on saying to the poor – in India all the Indian religions, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism – all go on saying, “It is your past life’s bad actions, that’s why you are poor.” That’s the reason – because of these religions – that for five thousand years at least, India has never revolted, has suffered all kinds of poverty, slavery, and accepted it. The religious leaders were telling them, “If you rebel or if you do anything against it, you will have to suffer in the future life.”
> 
> Let me tell you one thing: you will be surprised. One of the great Jaina teachers in India is Acharya Tulsi. There is a Jaina sect, Terapanth, and he is the head of that community. Their basic philosophy is that if somebody is dying of thirst, and you have water, don’t give it to him – because he is suffering from his past life’s karmas, and giving him water means interfering into the punishment. He will be punished again soon, he cannot get rid of it – and by interfering, you have committed a crime: now you will suffer also.
> 
> If somebody is drowning, simply go on walking. Let him drown – it is his past life’s actions, and you should not interfere in any way. For example, if you pull that man out of the water and tomorrow he murders somebody, you are also responsible for that murder. You see, the logic is great! If you had not saved that man, the murder would not have happened. So in the next life you will also suffer, because you saved that man and took part in the murder.
> 
> If you teach people for thousands of years that it is your bad actions in past lives which create poverty, you are stopping them from revolting, you are stopping them from doing something to change their situation. You are telling them, “Just accept the situation in which you are.” And that’s how the East has accepted, and remained poor.
> 
> And still you want that I should not speak against these people – Buddha, Mahavira? I have to speak. To me these are far bigger criminals than Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, because those people have done very little harm. Adolf Hitler killed six million Jews, but how many poor people has Mahavira killed? And living in poverty is far more dangerous, is far more of a suffering, than dying in a beautifully, scientifically-managed gas chamber in Germany. Within seconds you are smoke – holy smoke! – rather than suffering for millions of years.


Fundamental difference between the right and the left.

Left:

- Anarchy (no authority) is the natural state.
- And it is peace.
- Setting rigid conditions that disturbs this peace causes war.

Right:

- Anarchy (no authority) is the natural state. (Exception: Islam, thinks rule of Allah is the natural state)
- And it is chaos.
- When certain rigid conditions are met, it leads to peace.

Theists say God has commanded them to follow XYZ laws.
Atheists say "Common Sense", defined as the sense of the majority and tradition defines these laws.

On the other hand, the far-left believes in anarchism.
The moderate left believes that people have believed numerous foolish things and have caused large scale wars and exploitation, so one must define what's right purely based on scientific evidence. This leads to materialism.

I'm on the position of the moderate left, while also being someone having spiritual knowledge. I believe materialism can only lead to peace when defined under the framework of non-dualistic spirituality.

**More on Left:**

Far leftists are usually artistically inclined, and lack the scientific rigour of moderate left (and accuse them of being right wingers), or the moral assertiveness of the right. Since even the wild world has principles, and we cannot live safely among tigers, their views never work out in the modern civilization. They are loud and lack discernment, and support Islamists thinking since they seem less rigid, they are better than the West. But little do they know Islam is a strategic religion where they stay silent like a wolf and pounce on you when the opportunity arrives. There are two mindsets when they support Islam. One is fooled by their rhetoric and thinks that they are a religion that emphasizes love, and believes ISIS is Mossad and 9/11 was by the Jews. In my view, they (Muslims) emphasize love, but only in-so-far as you cry as you read the Qur'aan. They love their family, so much that they kill those who leave this "family". The other, knows Islam is bad, but does not know how bad in detail, and foolishly thinks that the Western Christian nationalists can only be countered using Islamists, instead of fighting on their own. I view this as cowardice, in addition to it being grounded on foolishness, because if the Islamists take over, they will lose all they had. Though there are dangerous theocrats in the West, the distribution of problematic people is very less among Christians as compared to Muslims.

The most moderate of the leftists are called liberals. They are of two categories. There are those who believe that, like the right, some principles define co-existence, and unless they are met, there is no co-existence. Then there is the other category whoever performs the most violence is wrong. In my view, the latter are less informed. Some among the first are communists (not socialists, i.e. not authoritarians), and others are capitalists. The ones that are capitalists are called libertarians or anarcho-capitalists. The communists, and the other leftists are called anarcho-communists.

Between the moderate left and the far left lies the Marxist spectrum. Marxists believe that history is explained through the ways in which people learn to distribute wealth. The wild is anarchic, but as man had intellect, he chose to control property. This began with the change from primitive communism, to slave society, to feudalism (one owns all the property) to capitalism, and he proposed this will turn into socialism (state owns all the property) and then back to the more educated communism. Lenin was the one who first tried to implement this with the October Revolution.

Aurora Aksnes is a far leftist (anarchist). I'm an anarcho-communist, but I realize hierarchy is important, as polity is not possible when people are not all equally educated. So I prefer an aristocracy (not oligarchy) as a safe layer to protect the structure of the anarcho-communist polity.
