Arguments against Devil: If the devil was so smart, wouldn't he know that God is the basis of all things, and therefore, he has no independent existence from him?

The divine feminine refers to the creative aspect of God, while the masculine refers to the static aspect of God.
They are not two aspects. And God is not gendered.
Every person is too, likewise, on a spectrum of being with masculine and feminine traits.
That explains transgenders too.

On Mi Yodeya:
I'm an Indian theologer, and one of my beleifs is that - I've been interested in Judah-ism - my question is, why is God referred to in the masculine?

I guess a broader question would be, why does language use gendered pronouns? What benefit does it convey?
If the male and female were referred to by with ust one pronoun, the androgynous wouldn't need a third term.
