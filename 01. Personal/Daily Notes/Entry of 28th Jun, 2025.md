1] Arguments against Devil: If the devil was so smart, wouldn't he know that God is the (causa?) basis of all things, and therefore, he has no independent existence from him?

2] The divine feminine refers to the creative aspect of God, while the masculine refers to the static aspect of God.
They are not two aspects. And God is not gendered.
Every person is too, likewise, on a spectrum of being with masculine and feminine traits.
That explains transgenders too.

3] On Mi Yodeya:
I'm an Indian theologer, and one of my beleifs is that non-dual, which means everything that is separate from other things are illusions - I've been interested in Judah-ism - we believe that God is without attributes, but we need attributes to refer to God - my question is, why is God referred to in the masculine?

I guess a broader question would be, why does language use gendered pronouns? What benefit does it convey?
If the male and female were referred to by with just one pronoun, the androgynous wouldn't need a third term.

4] On Free WIll:
God subtends a limited free will on to us, just as we subtend a limited free-will on to LLMs. However, if the LLM does not behave in accordance with our will, then we nudge it. God forgets that he is in control to let things play out, but it is only through God's will that eveerything ultimateely plays out.
