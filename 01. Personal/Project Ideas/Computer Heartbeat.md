I propose that every computer should have a heartbeat system, which allows to user to see when the computer is at state of heavy load.

This is similar to :
- The human heartbeat
- The blinking cursor
- The chassis LED light

Calling it a heartbeat should not cause confusion, because under the non-dualist framework, all entities share the same principles.

Why:
- The animated heartbeat visual can help the user find that the system is strong enough to run the heartbeat system.
- The rate of the heartbeat visual can help the user see that the system is experiencing a high usage.
- The colour of the heartbeat visual can help the user see it.

As food for thought, we may not completely disagree on it. I believe in non-dualism, under the idea that two entities can only exist separately if they are embedded in a common medium, and they are fundamentally separate to begin with. But then, I'm an idealist, so I think matter arises through consciousness rather than the other way around. Then the question is whether all of the consciousness becomes the physical reality, or only a part of it. If the latter is true, then there is no difference between the two positions, except with the difference that materialism does not believe in an agency of consciousness independent of the mind.
