They firstly think that only their religion is true.
And therefore they think that all non-Muslims (non-submitters) are Kafirs (hiders), and are materialists.
That is, they believe all people of other religions know their beliefs are false, and they are all truly materialists.

Therefore they say, we won't understand the the glory of fighting and dying in war, since we are materialists. That is their rationale for pointing out how they continue to fight in Gaza, and how the Quraysh did not fight back and chose to give up and convert.

This is totally based off of their delusion that 1) all others are liars 2) they are all materialists and 3) the only idea that is not materialist is their idea of dualistic theism and divine command as prescribed by Muhammad.

Believing something like that itself is crazy and one would have to be deeply tied in some mental knots
