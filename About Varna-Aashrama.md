Varna-Aashrama was made by Eeshvara. It was destroyed by Eeshvara too.

To say in Malayalam:

വർണാശ്രമം ഉണ്ടാക്കിയത് ഈശ്വരൻ തന്നെ.
അത് പൊളിച്ചതും ഈശ്വരൻ തന്നെ.

The Varna Aashrama allowed people to explore the different aspects of life to one's own satisfaction. However, it evolved into a sense of hierarchy and bigotry, and at that point, it deserved to be replaced, and by the system of capitalism, where every man has a chance to fight and rise to the ranks, without a care for morality. It will soon be replaced by the more educated communist system, as people realize that resources can be shared more meaningfully.
