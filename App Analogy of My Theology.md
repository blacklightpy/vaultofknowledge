Consider an app, which when opened, shows a screen with many elements.

```

   [APP SCREEN ELEMENTS]
  
   \                   /
    \                 /
     \               /
      \             /
         [ PHONE ]  
                
         \       /
          \     /
           \   /
           [APP]

```
Here, though the elements of the app are many, the app is only one.

The illusion of separation of the app elements is only because of the phone.
But the phone is different from the app.

In the context where we are referring to app elements as separate, the app exists separately.
But when we are referring to the true nature of the app, there is only one app.
And the phone is not part of the app.

But the phone exists separately from the app right?
Yes, that is in this particular example, since both things are already separate within a world of duality.

We can continue this analogy.

(draft:)
+NOTE: In both diagrams, in the first, to the app elements, their cause is the app, as interpreted by the phone. Just that the app and the phone are different. In the other, the cause of the world is Brahman, as seen under the veil.

```

   [     THE WORLD     ]
   
   \                   /
    \                 /
     \               /
      \             /
         [ SHAKTI ]  
                
         \       /
          \     /
           \   /
         [BRAHMAN]

```

Now, Shakti does not actively cause it. Shakti leads to Maya, and under Maya, Brahman appears divided, as the world.

Like a stranger may confuse a mirror image of another person with that person, or one may identify with the character they're playing in an immersive game, because it emulates the real person very closely, likewise, the reflection of pure consciousness itself retains properties of consciousness. To be precise, the reflection of a person on a mirror is a reflection of their body, but reflection of consciousness is a reflection of consciousness, and not of the inert body.

Now, in theory, the duty of the reflection is to realize that it is the whole. But wait, the reflection did not choose to be born, so how can it have any control on when he has to realize himself as the whole? Some parts of this theory has value, but not all of it makes sense. Like, if I can be unaware today and aware tomorrow, then it points at continuity, but that is something that does not exist ultimately. That is, there is no reason for Maya to be such that a person will go from non-knowledge to self-realization.

Well, it could be argued that the nature of the veil is to change in a certain way as to take a reflection on this journey. But that's not different from saying whatever happens happens, just with the exception that you also get to know what does happen in the end.

But then it gives no meaning to suffering. Suffering is simply baked in to reality. For what reason though? Why would all knowing Brahman also know that the way of dualistic reality is to go through suffering? To escape this is why one surrenders to the will of God. As long as one surrenders to God's will as right, they won't be saddened by their will.
