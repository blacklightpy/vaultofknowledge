Consider an app, which when opened, shows a screen with many elements.

```

   [APP SCREEN ELEMENTS]
  
   \                   /
    \                 /
     \               /
      \             /
         [ PHONE ]  
                
         \       /
          \     /
           \   /
           [APP]

```
Here, though the elements of the app are many, the app is only one.

The illusion of separation of the app elements is only because of the phone.
But the phone is different from the app.

In the context where we are referring to app elements as separate, the app exists separately.
But when we are referring to the true nature of the app, there is only one app.
And the phone is not part of the app.

But the phone exists separately from the app right?
Yes, that is in this particular example, since both things are already separate within a world of duality.

We can continue this analogy.
