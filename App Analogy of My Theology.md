Consider an app, which when opened, shows a screen with many elements.

```

   [APP SCREEN ELEMENTS]
  
   \                   /
    \                 /
     \               /
      \             /
         [ PHONE ]  
                
         \       /
          \     /
           \   /
           [APP]

```
Here, though the elements of the app are many, the app is only one.

The illusion of separation of the app elements is only because of the phone.
But the phone is different from the app.

In the context where we are referring to app elements as separate, the app exists separately.
But when we are referring to the true nature of the app, there is only one app.
And the phone is not part of the app.

But the phone exists separately from the app right?
Yes, that is in this particular example, since both things are already separate within a world of duality.

We can continue this analogy.

   [     THE WORLD     ]

    \                 /
     \               /

         [ SHAKTI ]

Now, Shakti does not actively cause it. Shakti leads to Maya, and under Maya, Brahman appears divided, as the world.

Like a stranger may confuse a mirror image of another person with that person, or one may identify with the character they're playing in an immersive game, because it emulates the real person very closely, likewise, the reflection of pure consciousness itself retains properties of consciousness. To be precise, the reflection of a person on a mirror is a reflection of their body, but reflection of consciousness is a reflection of consciousness, and not of the inert body.
