# Good Info

**One finds whom to trust for Shabda using the Antah Karana Pramaana (The Epistemologic Source of Inner Faculties), with honesty. This leads one to the Gurus, Rishis, and Parents, and any Avataars of that era.**

The source of this idea is the answer Yudhishtira gave the Yaksha in Yaksha Prashna.

For the reference for the Mahabharata verse, see [[Trying to find the reference for a verse|here]], because I first only found this by Prabhupada when Googling it, and it turns out the text I referred to had truncated it, and the online versions I looked were paged differently, and ChatGPT also couldn't find the exact reference and it confused me.

Nevertheless, although seeing Prabhupada's words eventually led me to finding the true source, I also ended up seeing some problematic stuff in his ways, which brings us to the next section.
# Bad Info

Prabhupada however seems to use it for his agenda, by claiming that logic is futile and disgusting, and only devotion according to his way can lead to good living and attainment of truth. I took more notes here: [[Problems with ISKCON and its founder Prabhupada]].

I saw another example in **another site** [here](https://gitabase.com/eng/NBS/75) too:

> [!NOTE] Snippet
> The bhakti method of receiving truth is by paramparā, or disciplic succession. It is confirmed by a checks-and-balances system of hearing from guru, śāstra, and sādhu. On the other hand, one who rejects the paramparā system and persists in hearing argumentation will never understand the Absolute Truth. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states, bhaktyā mām abhijānāti: "One can understand Me only by devotional service" (Bg. [18.55](https://gitabase.com/eng/bg/18/55)).
> 
> When Lord Caitanya first came to Jagannātha Purī, a dispute arose between His followers and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was at that time a mundane logician. The Bhaṭṭācārya and his students refused to accept that Lord Caitanya was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although Gopīnātha Ācārya presented much evidence from Vedic scriptures. Finally the disciples of the Bhaṭṭācārya said, "We derive knowledge of the Absolute Truth by logical hypothesis." Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "One cannot attain real knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such logical hypothesis and argument" (Cc. Madhya [6.81](https://gitabase.com/eng/cc/2/6/81)). Gopīnātha Ācārya further stated that only that person who has received the mercy of the Lord by rendering Him devotional service can understand Him. Logical hypothesis is not the way, but rather śabda-brahma, hearing from authorized sources. Lord Brahmā made the same point in his prayers to Lord Kṛṣṇa in Chapter Fourteen of the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:
> 
> > athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-  
> > prasāda-leṣānugṛhīta eva hi  
> > jānāti tattvaṁ bhagavan-mahimno  
> > na cānya eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan
> 
> "My Lord, one who is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate in order to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years" (SB [10.14.29](https://gitabase.com/eng/sb/10/14/29)).
