Not one of this can explain the ultimate reality completely, but then we use multiple analogies together.

From Mundaka Upanishad 1.1.7:

> yathorṇanābhiḥ sṛjate gṛhṇate ca yataḥ pṛthivyām oṣadhayaḥ sambhavanti yathā sataḥ puruṣāt keśalomāni tathākṣarāt sambhavatīha viśvam

- Spider weaving web (flaw: spiders can leave web)
- Herbs growing on earth
- Hair growing on humans

Also, spiders use will, while the other two don't.

Clay-Pot analogy.
Water-Waves Analogy

### Unverified
Chaandogya Upanishad 6.1.4-6.1.7:

> vācārambhaṇaṁ vikāro nāmadheyaṁ mṛttiketyeva satyam
> 
> All transformations are just names based upon speech; the clay alone is real.

- Clay Pot analogy

Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad 2.1.9:

> yathā ha vai lohamayaṁ karaṇam nipuṇena kartṛṇā vibhajyamānaṁ nānā-rūpaṁ bhavati
> 
> Ornaments made from gold – they may appear different, but are all gold.

- Gold Ornaments analogy

### Hot Rod - Flame Analogy
Prashna Upanishd 5.5's Shankara Bhashya:

> yathāgniḥ ekadhā arciḥ...
> 
> Iron rod in fire glows like fire but is still iron – a metaphor for jīva appearing as Brahman.

### Water-Waves Analogy

This is more common inAdvaita texts like Viveka Choodaamani, Drg-Drishya Viveka, Panchadashi, but its seed ideas are found in Shruthi:

Chaandogya Upanishad 7.23.1

> sa eṣa neti netyātmā...
> 
> implies the formless substratum, akin to water-wave analogy)

Ṛgveda 1.164.46:

> ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti

### Dream and Waking States

Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.9

> sa yathā swapne mahārājā bhavati..."
> 
> The Self creates its own world in dream—suggesting māyā and projection

Similar to Maandookya Upanishad 3-7 (analysis of Avasthas)
### Reflections

Also found in Viveka Choodaamani.

Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad 2.5.19

Also in Katha Upanishad 2.2.9

> yathā dīpo nivāta-stho...
> 
> (not the same analogy, but a metaphor for the subtle Self)
