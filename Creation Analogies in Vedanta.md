Not one of this can explain the ultimate reality completely, but then we use multiple analogies together.

From Mundaka Upanishad 1.1.7:

- Spider weaving web (flaw: spiders can leave web)
- Herbs growing on earth
- Hair growing on humans

Also, spiders use will, while the other two don't.

Water-Pot analogy.
