1. Yarushalami / Eretz Yisra'El / Jerusalem / Palestinian Talmud

Structure:

1. Daf (Middle Portion: Mishnah + Gemara)
2. Tosafot (External Portion: Addentums)

The Bavli Talmud's pagination starts from page 2a. The Baalbatishe explanation is that it is due to typesetting reasons, where the title page is considered page 1. The Yeshivache explanation is that it signifies how the Torah Shebaal Peh is not standalone, but is a continuation of Torah Shebichsav.

Each page-unit in the Talmud, called Daf, is a folio, with two pages a and b.

A Sage from the Mishnah-ic era is called a Tanna, while a Sage from the Talmud-ic era is called an Amora.

Rabbi is a formal title only given to sages through the ceremony called the Shemichah, done within Eretz Yisra'El. The ones who did not have this done are called Rav. So anyone who is called Rav is a Babylonian Amora.
