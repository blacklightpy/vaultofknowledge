This is an argument put forward by the spiritualists, who follow
non-dualism.

However, as often, while they make their statements, they tend to
make it quick, and they don't address the nuances in their arguments.

While their metaphysics is often true, that is, from the non-dualist
position, they are often right for the wrong reasons.

(Now note that I judge from the authority of Indian traditions, but
I do so not because of dogma, but because they have explored the details
surrounding this particular topic, and have addressed all the seeming
contradictions. Again, this is only possible because reality is set in
place by a higher power, and there is an order to it, while there is a
lack of order at the same time.)

**So my argument for this particular topic is that:** if there is a God who
set up this whole reality, how can people prevent you from knowing God
unless it is God himself who set reality to be this way? And if you think
it is not God, but your own self, then again, and worse, how is it possible
unless you yourself set it this way?

Then, why would you ever want to help other people know this? A) Did this God
of yours ask you in particular to do that? (In that case you'd identify as a
prophet, which has it's own problems) OR B) Did you think that while you are
one, you have a responsiblity to tell others that they are ultimately the same
as you, that is, not just in nature, but in material as well?

So the people who make this argument are not 

I term this **spiritual victim mentality**.
