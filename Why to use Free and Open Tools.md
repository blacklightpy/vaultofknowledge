I have a theory of crystals.


Now if the closed source tools, as long as they are not changing, it is fine.

For example, if I am making a game, I want the game engine I'm using to be predictable. If the next update of Unity would make it unusable, I'd be unable to complete my game. This is not a problem with Unity specifically, but several SaaS tools and Android apps have this problem, where you are not able to roll back to an older iteration.
