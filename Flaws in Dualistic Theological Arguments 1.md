This note deals with analogies conveyed to humans that sounds meaningful from a social perspective, but do not at the ultimate level.

They say: God decreed by command.

But what is a "command" as it is understood by humans? And does this apply at the ultimate reality with God being the only self? No, since there is no one else to command to. See [[Examples of Duality arising from Non-Duality]].

Likewise, we must examine other claims by defining them as it is known by humans, and thinking whether it applies at the ultimate reality.

For example:
- The Sun prostrates before God (isn't God beyond time and space?)
- The world separate from himself (My argument this makes for an impossible material cause)
