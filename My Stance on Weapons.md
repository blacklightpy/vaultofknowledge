About protests against nuclear weapons, I wonder what is being protested against. (I'm not talking about USA's political issues by which they accuse the protesters under the label "communists" which in their dictionary refers to those who are enemies of the state; and I've written regarding that [[The lousiness of those who criticize communism|here]]). Is it against (1) the knowledge, (2) construction or (3) use?

You cannot protest against gravity, it is truth. Likewise, you cannot protest against the knowledge of weapons. To do so is to take an insecurely materialist position.

**On my stance:**

(1) We must have the knowledge of how they work, so that we do not remain naive. But we must not use it on others.

(2)And we must also construct them, but we must do so with safety guidelines. And the fear of this can only be avoided by the knowledge of God. In fact, a materialist would be afraid of anything if they had enough knowledge of it, so much so that their idea of materialism simply only stems from their being in their comfort zone build over the years by civilization.

**On how these technologies may actually be used:**

Certain terraforming techniques may require us to break apart and restructure the entire ecosystem of an uninhabited planet, or to drag entire planets to different locations. Besides, spaceships by themselves don't run on 9-volt batteries.
