Beam Divergence / Beam Spread is modelled using Guassian beams. Related: [[LASER]].

Also think of the science park parabolic sound mirrors.

We can derive a Guassian beam by many means. It is an eigen-solution of a resonator problem which we can solve. But it is complex.

Another way is to derive it from a very phenomenological point of conflict.
