What we need is not a supply of cash, but a steady stream of cash.

Think of it like how when your body loses energy, you would need to supply the right amount of food. Or something more continuous like how as a computer performs operations, we need to supply the right amount of electrical power for it to keep performing that load (and also cool). i.e. feeding requirements in realtime.

I need to think of the right amount of cash flow I need in various circumstances. Of course, in some cases, like for a surgery, I need some collected up cash. Think of it like collecting some water into a bucket. I'll need to plan this in a spreadsheet with an AI to assist me with quick detailed calculations.

Questions to ask:
- What is the stream of cash required for a person?
- If everyone has that minimum stream of cash, will it affect the prices of things?
- Does the world have the resource flow capacity to handle it?

This question arises from my knowledge of how, although some people hold so much capital, since capital is only a token that allows resource flow, and not the actual resources (see [[The Map Is Not the Territory]]), do we know if there are actual resources that can flow in accordance with the capital? For example, I may have 50K Rs., but a product I want that just costs 5K Rs. may simply be out of stock.
