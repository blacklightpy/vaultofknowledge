This means Divine Voice. An example of its use is in resolving the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit HIllel (see here: [[Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel]]).

## Regarding its validity

**Talmud, Seder Moed, Megillah 32a, 11:**

> ואמר ר' שפטיה אמר ר' יוחנן מנין שמשתמשין בבת קול שנאמר (ישעיהו ל, כא) ואזניך תשמענה דבר מאחריך לאמר והני מילי דשמע קל גברא במתא וקל איתתא בדברא והוא דאמר הין הין והוא דאמר לאו לאו
> 
> **And Rabbi Shefatya said** that **Rabbi Yoḥanan said:** If one was deliberating about whether to do a certain action, and a Divine Voice indicated what he should do, **from where** is it derived **that one may make use of a Divine Voice** and rely upon it? **As it is stated: “And your ears shall hear a word behind you saying:** This is the way, walk in it” (Isaiah 30:21). The Gemara comments: **This applies** only **when one heard a male voice in the city,** which is unusual, for men are usually found in the fields, **or** when one heard **a female voice in the fields,** for women are generally not found there. Since the voice is unusual, one need not doubt it and may rely upon it. **And that** applies **when** the voice repeated its message and **said: Yes, yes. And that** also applies **when** the voice **said: No, no.**

**The Handbook of Jewish Thought by Rabbi Kaplan, 6:6:32:** 

> A bath kol is like a voice heard in the mind. Although it sometimes sounds like a voice from heaven, it is a prophetic, rather than a physical voice, and it is only heard by those for whom it is intended. It was a voice often heard by neophytes not yet ready for privacy. Regarding the bath kol it is written, “Your ears shall hear a voice behind you” (Isaiah 30:21).

**Guide for the Perplexed, 2:42:**

> The bat-kol (prophetic echo), which is so frequently mentioned by our Sages, and is something that may be experienced by men not prepared for prophecy.

## Distinguishing it from evil whispers

### Case 1: Oven of Akhnai

The phrase "Lo Bashamayim Hi" (Not in Heaven) was derived from this story. This is to say that the meaning of the Torah is not to be uncovered by prophets, or even by the voice of God, but is to be interpreted by humans. Likewise, the Midrashic reading of Deuteronomy 17:11 is that God's will was revealed at Sinai its Grundnorm (basic norm), and he entrusted
