I made this note specifically to study those who wrote the [[Dharma Soothras]] and [[Dharma Shastra]]. That is, Apasthamba, Gauthama, Baudhaayana and Vasishta; and the Smrithi texts attributed to Manu, Yaajnavaalkya, Naarada and Vishnu.

- Saptharishis
	- According to Jaiminiya Braahmana of Saama Veda (Verses 2.218â€“221)
		- Agastya, Atri, Bhardwaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Vashistha, and Vishvamitra
	- According to Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad of Yajur Veda (Verse 2.2.6)
		- Atri, Bharadvaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kashyapa, Vashistha, and Vishvamitra
	- According to Gopatha Braahmana of Atharva Veda (Verse 1.2.8)
		- Vashistha, Vishvamitra, Jamadagni, Gautama, Bharadvaja, Gungu, Agastya, and Kashyapa.

Saptharishis differ by the Manavanthara, and they are mind borns of Brahma. A Manavanthara or reign of Manu is a timeline that lasts for 14 Yuga Cycles, and there are 17 of them in a Kalpa.
