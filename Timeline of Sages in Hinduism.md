I made this note specifically to study those who wrote the [[Dharma Soothras]] and [[Dharma Shastra]]. That is, Apasthamba, Gauthama, Baudhaayana and Vasishta; and the Smrithi texts attributed to Manu, Yaajnavaalkya, Naarada and Vishnu.

Saptharishis differ by the Manavanthara, and they are mind borns of Brahma. A Manavanthara or reign of Manu is a timeline that lasts for 71 Yuga Cycles, and there are 14 of them in a Kalpa. Each Manavanthara is followed and the first is preceded by a Manavanthara Sandhya that lasts for the duration of a Sathya Yuga. During a Manavanthara Sandhya, the Bhoo Loka is submerged in water.

In each Manavanthara, the Saptharishis, an Indra, a Manu and sons of Manu (kings) are created. Each Manavanthara is marked by the Manu that rules over it. In Malsya Puraana, there is a story abou the current Manu building a boat to rescue the Saptharishis from a flood.
