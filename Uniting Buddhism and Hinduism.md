Buddhism posits that there is no permanent self. Hinduism posits that there is only a permanent self.

My take on this is that the self needs the illusion in order to perceive itself, or rather, the self-perception of the permanent self itself is what causes the illusion.

Because of that, when you detach from the illusion, then you are without self-perception, and you reach a state of not knowing the self.

While Buddhism says "no self", I say "no perception is the original state of the self". That is, while Buddha says "anatta", I say "asanna".
