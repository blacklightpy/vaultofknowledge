For example, Devanaagari packs more detail (as evident from comparing the Devanaagari script and its IAST transliteration), and the same is true for Bengali.

So, I checked and propose the following scaling for those scripts (to be implemented by font-size CSS property):

- Devanaagari: 145%
- Bengali: 150%

Now of course, this depends on the typeface. I chose this scaling based on the typeface used in my Obsidian theme, but my website seems to have a different typeface. So I need to check it too.
