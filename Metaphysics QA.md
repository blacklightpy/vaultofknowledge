Q1. If a tree fell in a forest, and no one heard it, did it really make a sound?

A1. Yes, it did. The signals merely did not get picked up by the ears and become "audio."

But what is also true is that if there was no sentient being, there would be no record of any event, including this one. But we do have records. This implies that sentience is more than a material phenomena.
