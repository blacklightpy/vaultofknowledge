Is it easier said than done? Anyways, here's the poem.

> ABOLISH WAR
> By H.H. SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA
> 
> War is the highest Barbarism.
> It is the most horrible Crime.
> It is monstrous and horrible Villainy.
> It is manâ€™s crowning stupidity.
> It leads to disaster and destruction.
> O Scientist! Abandon Bomb manufacturing.
> Try sincerely to make Peace among nations.
> O Dictators! O Presidents!
> Attempt to effect World Peace.
> You will not gain anything through wars.
> You have rejected the Sermon on the Mount.
> You preach against religion and God.
> This indeed is a grave, great blunder.
> Establish Peace, Brotherhood & Unity centres everywhere.
> Invite men of goodness, holiness and love from everywhere.
> And they will guide you and show you the way to world welfare and happiness.
> O ye all men, you are my brothers in the Spirit.
> O ye my global brothers Abolish war. Stop wars. Put an end to all wars.
> Peace, peace, peace be unto all, everywhere.
> 
> Beloved friends! May we all work together to make this planet Earth of ours an abode of Peace. Proclaim Peace! Pray for Peace. Work for Peace. Live for your life to bring about an era of Peace. May Godâ€™s Peace fill your heart, now and always.
> 
> Om. May there be peace in heaven. May there be peace in the sky. May there be peace on earth. May there be peace in the water. May there be peace in the plants. May there be peace in the trees. May there be peace in the Gods. May there be peace in Brahman (God). May there be peace in all. May that peace, real peace, be mine.
