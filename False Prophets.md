The ones to be judged the harshest are the false prophets, those who claim moral grounds, but mislead others. On these grounds, we agree.

There is no use to criticizing me, as I've read all the works and I disagree with them. And pressuring is a form of violence. I do not have any misunderstanding of what's written, I simply assert with all honesty that these are not revelations from god.

There's no word-trickery here, the words mean exactly as one would read it.

Now, for false prophets their fruits would reveal. But then, following my path that is different will reveal a result that is different from the ideals of the belief systems I disagree with. That is not an indicator of a flaw in my system, it's an indicator of how much it deviates from what you consider right.

If it leads to outcomes it does not promise, only then can it be considered problematic.

Ultimately, if you take my path, you take the responsibilities too. For that reason, only those who agree with it have to choose this path. I am not someone who gives you promises, I simply lead by example.
