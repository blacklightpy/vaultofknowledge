Soothra-s (short notes):

(1) Like a shadow

(2) God is the Efficient Cause and Material Cause of the World

(3) But they wonder, whether the shadow is different from the source

(4) A shadow needs a Glow, Obstruction and Screen. At least a Glow and Obstruction.

(5) So a minimum of 1 and 0 powers (Vikshepa, Avarna)

(6) 1s and 0s can generate patterns (like ASCII art, especially as you zoom out)

(7) Combinations of patterns at different scales can generate variations.
Like how all colours are merely combinations of light at different frequencies,
filtered by our eyes. Merely a different form of data.
