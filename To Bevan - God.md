Soothra-s (short notes):

(1) Like a shadow

(2) God is the Efficient Cause and Material Cause of the World

(3) But they wonder, whether the shadow is different from the source

(4) A shadow needs a Glow, Obstruction and Screen. At least a Glow and Obstruction.

(5) So a minimum of 1 and 0 powers (Vikshepa, Avarna)

(6) 1s and 0s can generate patterns (like ASCII art, especially as you zoom out)

(7) Combinations of patterns at different scales can generate variations.
Like how all colours are merely combinations of light at different frequencies,
filtered by our eyes. Merely a different form of data.

Just as you fashion characters in your dream, but you yourself are a central character.
God fashions you in his dream, but you may not be a central character.

And while your dream leaves memories in your mind,
God's dream is not stored in his mind.

Also, God creates the dream, not you.
God may create dreams so that you know you are created in the same way.
