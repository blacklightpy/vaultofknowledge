Soothra-s (short notes):

(1) Like a shadow

(2) God is the Efficient Cause and Material Cause of the World

(3) But they wonder, whether the shadow is different from the source

(4) A shadow needs a Glow, Obstruction and Screen. At least a Glow and Obstruction.

(5) So a minimum of 1 and 0 powers (Vikshepa, Avarna)

(6) 1s and 0s can generate patterns (like ASCII art, especially as you zoom out)

(7) Combinations of patterns at different scales can generate variations.
Like how all colours are merely combinations of light at different frequencies,
filtered by our eyes. Merely a different form of data.

**Dream Analogy:**

(1) Just as you fashion characters in your dream,
God fashions you in his dream.

(2) And while your dream (dream world) leaves memories in your mind,
God's dream (this world) is not stored in his mind, but in your mind, and in that of others too.
However, characters in your dream have memories too, which are not stored in your mind.
This means the memories of others are only apparent to you, while they are not stored in your dream.
Still, you didn't create their memories, so they should be stored in God's mind.

(3) While you may find yourself to be a character in your dream,
You may not be that character in God's dream.

(4) Also, God creates the dream, not you.
God may create dreams so that you know you are created in the same way.

(5) Dream world is not as consistent as this world, even though it is not apparent while dreaming,
however when you wake up, you remember that the laws of physics were inconsistent.
This gives the idea that dreams are not as consistent as reality.
This also gives the idea that worlds made in the human mind are weaker than those made in God's mind.
