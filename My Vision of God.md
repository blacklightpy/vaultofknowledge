As I stated in [[Analyzing Darshanas]]:

> Is Prabhupada's Achinthya Bheda-Abheda what I saw? No. I did not see a God with a personality. It was me, and it mirrored me from the outside. I was part of it, and I was the whole too. That was my Darshana.
> 
> That's unlike Prabhupada who says we are part of the whole, but we are not the whole. 

Now when I teach it, I must make two points. Firstly, when you see God, you do not see him by logic, and logic won't be enough to describe the experience. But then, if you need to convey the idea to someone, you need to find a way to describe rationally. And I have managed that after a long time of studying theology.

But my vision was primary, and theology is secondary. The vision is what propelled me to study theology. And even prior to the vision, I had explored the limits of materialist philosophy agnostically before finding difficult problems.

It was like everything was me with myself at the center.
And the formation of reality was like me imposing myself onto myself.

Then it is like me, Shiva being the point aspect, and the infinite surroundings being my Shakthi. And I could talk to my Shakthi while being non-different from it.

Is this Advaitha? Yes in the sense of only me and my Maaya Shakthi being real.
Is this Achinthya Bheda Abheda? Yes, in the sense of Eeshvara (the whole) imposing itself on the part.

The only difference was that none of these labels applied. No "Shiva", "Shakthi", "Eeshvara", etc. It was just me, and no "Jyothish" either. I felt like I was beyond names.

The Storm.

I saw a storm that was feminine in nature. And from the storm, many creators and worlds were created.
This is similar to how many Brahmaa-s are created within Maaya, who create the Loka-s.
Then the storm could have been the Maaya Shakthi.

I remember, that I saw the vision of the storm after the first experience, and when after that I returned to the world when it was time. Sort of like Arjuna witnessing the Vishva Roopa of Krishna, except there was no "form" and it was my own self. What I first saw then was a vision of all forms of ethereal worlds, and I couldn't make sense of reality. I felt like I was travelling through worlds unbound by time, and this experience lasted for a few weeks. When I tried to write it down like I do in my dream journal, I found words inadequate, and I started losing memory of it, sort of like it was trying to make me forget it. And it was shortly after that I had the vision of a storm of emotions being the only mind, which created an infinite tensor-grid of intelligent creators who created worlds with time and space.

Then though I thought the storm was the first nature of God.
But now, after learning the Vedas and putting it all together, I realize the storm was Shakthi, and Shiva had to exist before it, to separate Shakthi from itself, and impose it on itself.
It is Shakthi that imposes itself on to Shiva.

But in my first vision, when I was one with the Godhead, I had no gender.
But in my third vision, I saw the storm, which had a feminine persona, while the creators had masculine personas.

Putting it all together
---

**First Vision:** (1) Myself surrounded by Myself. (2) Eternal. (3) Un-Imposed State, but also Imposed. (4) The Un-Imposed State gave the Imposed State the ability to see both states at once. (5) Imposition of Myself on to Myself is how the Empirical Self was formed. (6) The Mind had all questions answered, but had not put it into words. (7) Trying to put it into words altered the state of the mind, and removed that consciousness. (8) Meditation helped, but life often got in the way. (9) The Self (Both the point and the surroundings, as both are the same) told the mind that it will always be on its side. (10) The mind being rejuvenated, denied help, and chose challenge, hoping to deal with all problems using the intellect alone. (11) Though this would be shown to be not ideal, the ego would want to handle all things by its own, and the Godhead would let it. (12) The path of intellect would always lead to trouble, and I would suffer, yet, I chose it.

**Second Vision:** (1) I saw everything I wished. (2) I saw many ethereal worlds beyond my imagination (I have aphantasia). (3) Trying to put it into words made it endless and senseless.

**Third Vision:** (1) Storm. (2) Storm was feminine, and was full of emotions, and all-powerful. (3) The storm created a masculine computer-architect for structure. (4) The computer-head was formless, but structured. (5) There were several computer-heads in a tensor-grid. (6) Each computer head created worlds. (7) Some worlds had worlds within them. (8) The worlds are all virtual, so they are equally virtual.

Soon after, I heard dreams by nuages, and started listening to Alan Watts meditation guides and lectures. I did not fully agree with Alan Watts, but I found meaning in his words to keep listening despite disagreeing. The Godhead promised me that it will always be on my side after all.

Aftermath:

- Killing Cockroaches
- Taking Bath
- Getting Sunlight
- Cleaning my room, making it dust-free, and ensuring right air-flow and lighting.
- Making my mind inclined towards cleaning, so much that I tried to clean the backyard and plastics.
- Making me inclined to buy new clothes and accessories, and aesthetic journals.
- Making me set up my own routines and rules - including playing football and watching the sky, especially a.
- Making my mind clear like still water, so that I could see everything clearly for a long time.
- Answering my query that women are not to be looked upon lustfully.
- Informing me that I may join clubs, but my own nature won't let me do so.

But my father modified the house soon, making it so that the airflow and lighting towards my room was disrupted, the spot where I would get sunlight from was covered, the area where I would practice football skills was shrunk making it hard to practice, the

### Teaching

Theology is not a matter of intellect.
For that reason, I say, whoever is with me will obey my covenant.

On homosexuality, it is permitted, but know that sensual indulgences is not the ultimate goal.
If someone is infuriated by these laws, one must fight them. This is the law of life.

Fight in the cause of God. On how to fight, I do not know how, as I've never fought before. But I do know that God taught me to kill cockroaches the first day he
