As I stated in [[Analyzing Darshanas]]:

> Is Prabhupada's Achinthya Bheda-Abheda what I saw? No. I did not see a God with a personality. It was me, and it mirrored me from the outside. I was part of it, and I was the whole too. That was my Darshana.
> 
> That's unlike Prabhupada who says we are part of the whole, but we are not the whole. 

Now when I teach it, I must make two points. Firstly, when you see God, you do not see him by logic, and logic won't be enough to describe the experience. But then, if you need to convey the idea to someone, you need to find a way to describe rationally. And I have managed that after a long time of studying theology.

But my vision was primary, and theology is secondary. The vision is what propelled me to study theology. And even prior to the vision, I had explored the limits of materialist philosophy agnostically before finding difficult problems.

It was like everything was me with myself at the center.
And the formation of reality was like me imposing myself onto myself.

Then it is like me, Shiva being the point aspect, and the infinite surroundings being my Shakthi. And I could talk to my Shakthi while being non-different from it.

Is this Advaitha? Yes in the sense of only me and my Maaya Shakthi being real.
Is this Achinthya Bheda Abheda? Yes, in the sense of Eeshvara (the whole) imposing itself on the part.

The Storm.

I saw a storm that was feminine in nature. And from the storm, many creators and worlds were created.
This is similar to how many Brahmaa-s are created within Maaya, who create the Loka-s.
Then the storm could have been the Maaya Shakthi.

I remember, that I saw the vision of the storm after the first experience, and when after that I returned to the world when it was time. Sort of like Arjuna witnessing the Vishva Roopa of Krishna, except there was no "form" and it was my own self. What I first saw then was a vision of all forms of ethereal worlds, and I couldn't make sense of reality. I felt like I was travelling through worlds unbound by time, and this experience lasted for a few weeks. When I tried to write it down like I do in my dream journal, I found words inadequate, and I started losing memory of it, sort of like it was trying to make me forget it. And it was shortly after that I had the vision of a storm of emotions being the only mind, which created an infi

Then though I thought the
