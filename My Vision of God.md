As I stated in [[Analyzing Darshanas]]:

> Is Prabhupada's Achinthya Bheda-Abheda what I saw? No. I did not see a God with a personality. It was me, and it mirrored me from the outside. I was part of it, and I was the whole too. That was my Darshana.
> 
> That's unlike Prabhupada who says we are part of the whole, but we are not the whole.
