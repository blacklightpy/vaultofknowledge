Judah-ism considers that God is simple in his absolute unity. While Hasidic theologers found the material world to be in contradiction to God's simplicity, Maimonaides saw no contradiction.

The argument for the immanence of God is because (1) there is a belief that the Divine Life Force sustains the universe, and if it were to cease for any moment, the universe would cease to exist, and (2) God has absolute unity and is perfectly simple, and so if his sustaining power is within nature, his essence is also within nature.

## Creatio Ex-Nihilo

The Catholic Church held the view that God created reality from nothing, not from his self. The opposition to this is called creatio ex materia (Creation out of Material) or ex nihilo nihil fit (Nothing comes from Nothing).

Plotinus, the founder of Neo-Platonism, said that the world emanated from God, instead of being created. His view was unacceptable to Early Church Fathers, and was also rejected by Arabic and Hebrew philosophers.

CS Lewis also rejected radical dualism by saying that God never fight Satan, but rather, Satan is the rival of Michael, as a defense of moral absolutism. Others said that Satan fights God but by the free will given by God, and for the duration that God allows.
