See: https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2012-July/032603.html (Hard to read. It discusses the 7 generation rule for conversion to Brahmana Varna. It also talks about court cases that have been won. So I have to study it.)

**Parashara Smrithi:**

> 17] All laws arose in the Krita age; all have vanished in the Kali age. Expound a part of the rules of conduct fit for the four castes, such as are common (to all).

> 21] The author of the Veda there is none; (he) the four-faced (God), at each succeeding revolution of a Kalpa, recalls to mind the Veda; and so does Manu remember the law.
> 
> 22] In conformity to the character of the age, the rules of law (suitable) for men differ from age to age. The rules for the Krita differ from the Treta rules; the Dvapara laws are not identical with the Kali rules.

It points out that rules differ from time to time.
