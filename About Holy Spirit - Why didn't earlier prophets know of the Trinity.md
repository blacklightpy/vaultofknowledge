Question raised on Christianity SE: https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/105984/if-god-has-always-existed-as-a-triune-god-why-didnt-the-great-men-of-the-bible

- Our knowledge of God is only through natural means or by revelation through (1) Prophets, (2) Jesus or (3) Holy Spirit. Natural Knowledge is inadequate to reveal the Trinity.
- In the Old Testament, God made some things clear and kept other things a mystery.
- God kept aside some things to be revealed by Jesus and his disciples. Among these are the concepts of the Trinity and the salvation of the Gentiles by their acceptance into the church.

Like OP responded:

> I do not agree with using words like "mysteries" and "trying to understand God with our human mind". Salvation is a matter of life and death. A matter of eternal damnation. There should be nothing mysterious or requiring more than basic human reasoning for me to understand God. God gave me a human brain, soul, and intellect. He can not reveal himself in theological concepts that are beyond my human nature or that require more than basic reasoning for me to understand. I am not an angel.
