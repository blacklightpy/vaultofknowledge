Question: "If there is only Brahman, then who is the Sookshma Shareera that has Karma"?
Answer: "That's it, since there is only Brahman, Karma is only Maaya"

But then, up until that question, Karma was valid, but when asked about the details, it disappears. Now it can be said that Brahman is in Param Aarthika, and Sookshma Shareera is in Vyavahaarika. But the question was about the rational origin of Sookshma Shareera in Vyavahaarika, not in Param Aarthika. But as far as I know, since Param Aarthika is the "ultimate truth", all answers to deep questions have to be based there, making this reality an illusion.

This is an evasion of reasoning. Because all that this says is that society needs a structure, and this is the best structure we have found out, and this is justified on the basis of gods that do not really exist.
