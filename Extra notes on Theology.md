But maybe more like folding a paper in half, but that won't account for all the variations. Anyways, that's beyond cognitive comprehension.

No, because that separation is only found when looking at the veils. One only sees the veils in the world, the parts are hidden beneath them. One simply has to transcend beyond the veils by self-realization, and he becomes the whole.

But isn't the veils an effect of the power of the whole? Well, yes, and now that I rephrased the question, it makes sense. I was originally asking "isn't the power to make the veils a power of the whole?," but then I realized that actually, the whole doesn't do anything, and the veils are simply an effect.

Now, to add on all of this, at the boundaries of the illusion, there is a reflection of the light. Or maybe, see it as that in each part, there is a reflective part, i.e. by considering the veil as the entire diagram, not just the lines, and this reflection is the living being. And the sum whole of the reflections is the ultim
