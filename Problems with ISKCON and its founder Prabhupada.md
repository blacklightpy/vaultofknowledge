Source: https://prabhupadavani.org/transcriptions/720420sbhk/ (talk addressing children, discussing Sreemad Bhagavatham 7.6.1, the story of Hiranyakashipu and Prahlaada)

> This is a verse spoken by Prahlāda Mahārāja, Prahlāda Mahārāja, when he was a five-years-old boy, like all these children. _Kaumāra. Kaumāra_ age is called from five years to ten years. That is called _kaumāra._ So Prahlāda Mahārāja was born of an atheist father. **The father was atheist number one, Hiraṇyakaśipu. He is described as _rākṣasa,_ demon, like that. _Daitya. Daitya_ means demon.**

He repeats "atheist number one" a couple of times. Although Hiranyakashipu's fascism is what makes us hate him.

> **There are two classes of men. One class is called _daitya_ and the other class is called _devata. Dvau bhūta-sargau loke daiva āsura eva ca_ [Bg. 16.6]. There are two classes of men, known as _daiva,_ and another, _asura. Viṣṇu bhaktaḥ bhaved daiva āsuras tad viparyayaḥ._ Those who are devotees of the Lord, they are called _daiva_ or _devata,_ demigods. And those who are just the opposite number, they are called _daitya,_ or demon.**

> **He was very careful not to allow anyone. He appointed teachers for his son, strictly prohibiting about... Just like nowadays it has become..., what is called? State? Secular state. "Don't talk of God." This is the present situation of the world, atheist class. "Don't talk of God."**

He attacks "secularism" than Hiranyakashipu's fascism.

> But they do not know that they have not much improved by "Don't talk of God." The situation is becoming grimmer and grimmer. But they have no eyes to see. They have no eyes to see. This godless civilization will not make them happy. That's a fact. _Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad guṇa manorathena asato dhāvato bahiḥ_ [SB 5.18.12]. **If one is godless, then however qualified he may be from the material point of view, he is useless. _Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad guṇā._ He cannot have any good quality. Why? _Manorathena asato dhāvato bahiḥ._ Because he is on the mental platform. So by speculation on the mental platform, he will accept which is not spiritual. _Asata.** Asato māṁ sad gamaḥ._ That is the Vedic injunction. Don't keep yourself in the _asata,_ but you try to transcend to the _sat_ platform, _oṁ tat sat._ That means spiritual platform.

> So those who have no spiritual knowledge, they are on the mental platform. There are many platforms of our life. _Indriyānī parāṇy āhur indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ manasas tu parā buddhir_ [Bg. 3.42]. **So ordinarily we are bodily, we think, "I am this body." This is called... Body means my senses. So civilization based on this bodily concept of life are interested only sense gratification. That is their aim of life. _Indriya-tarṣaṇāt_[?], sense gratification. And those who are disgusted with sense gratification, they go little higher on the mental platform, mental speculation, just like philosophy, poetry, like that. Gross means they are working very hard day and night for sense gratification, just like hogs and dogs.**

In the above two paragraphs, he paints the idea that materialism is disgusting. I understand that it is not complete, but disgusting is a strong word.

> **That is stated in the _śāstra. Nāyaṁ deha deho bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye_ [SB 5.5.1]. Ṛṣabhādeva says that this human form of life is not meant for working so hard like cats and dogs. That is not recommended. _Ayam deha._ But the material world, people are so enchanted that working day and night they think, "I am enjoying." This is called _māyā._ Actually he is working day and night, and he is thinking that "I am happy. I am making progress." This is called _māyā._**

> **That is stated in the _śāstra. Nāyaṁ deha deho bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye_ [SB 5.5.1]. Ṛṣabhādeva says that this human form of life is not meant for working so hard like cats and dogs.

It's okay to see that work is not everything. But to call working a delusion is misleading. The total context makes it worse as you'll see next.

> So the world situation is very, very downward. Don't think that you are making progress. It is not progress. _Śāstra_ says, _parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam_ [SB 5.5.5]. So long a human being is not interested in the subject matter of _ātma-tattva,_ "What I am," then whatever he is doing, he is becoming defeated. He is not victorious; he is defeated. _Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto._

> **_Abodha-jāto._ He is a rascal, fool. He does not know what is his interest. He does not know that by nature's law,**

"Rascal"? Just because they work? This is way out of control.

(A few statements unimportant in context, but worth looking at)
> By nature's law we have to transmigrate in so many species of life---from aquatics to plants, trees, then insect, then flies, then birds, then beast, then uncivilized human being. Then we have got this civilized form---especially those who are born in India, because in India the _varṇāśrama-dharma_ is here.

> India, Hindu... "Hindu" is a foreign name given by the Muhammadans. Actually our real position is followers of the _varṇāśrama-dharma:_ four _varṇas_ and four _āśramas._ This is the stepping stone for civilized life, _varṇāśrama = brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra;_ and _brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa._

So he says Varna-Ashrama Dharma is the perfect path, and India gives it the best. And that Hindu is a Muhammadan term. Well, Varna-Ashrama is okay, as long as it is not imposed on all of us, I guess.

There is a Hindu nationalist movement which rejects this term, which is fair, but this term is not entirely Muhammadan in origin, because it was used by the Iranians and Greeks too, to refer to the residents beyond Sindhu river valley. But he took this opportunity to blame it all on Muhammadans, which is not truthful.

Now, the Hindu nationalist movements claim that the religion was Sanaathana Dharma, but that's just their way of

**His definition of Maaya:**

> **So _māyā_ is there. _Māyā_ does not want to lead the culprits. Because one who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's a culprit, so _māyā_ wants to give such person more and more trouble.** But Vaiṣṇava risks his life to snatch him from the hands of _māyā._ So _māyā,_ of course, when he [she] sees that "This man, this living entity, is now corrected; he is now taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness," then she will not disturb.
