#rough To Atheism (Specifically anti-non-materialism)

Note here that I'll be referring to anti-non-materialists as xmists, because most atheists are anti-non-materialists, however, not all are. xm is an acronym, and it should've been axm, but xm stands out so it also makes people use more of their neurons than otherwise to get the context.

*Why am I using the label xmist? Firstly, it is a lot shorter than anti-non-materialist, and I don't want to be grouping all atheists into that category, like how many xmists group all theists into the category of theocrats.*

Whenever a person from the illiterate laity makes an argument, such as how X or Y material phenomena is due to God or an ang, an xmist can quickly correct him using scientific explanations. 

Similarly, if a person who was bad in English would argue with a theist

They would say stuff like "why are you doing this, you know science." Then they try to suppress their voice.

This is because all belief systems are ultimately only based on our feelings, including atheism. There will always be unexplained phenomena. But there, the atheist claims
