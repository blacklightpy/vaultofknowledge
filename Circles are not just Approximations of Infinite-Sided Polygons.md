This disproves my earlier assumption, which I talked about (1) on my paper notes, (2) in [[Validity of Irrational Roots]] and (3) mentioned in [[Circles]].

To see it, one has to put a towel over his face (covering the eyes) on a sunny day, and he will see that there are a lot of circular spots visible at the locations of the holes, even though the holes aren't circular.

It's like light, upon passing through the holes spread out into a circle. I need to verify whether this is due to the light or due to the behaviour of the eyes on seeing light through holes.
