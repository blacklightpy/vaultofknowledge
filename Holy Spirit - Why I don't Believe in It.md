Firstly, God is One, since the efficient cause hs to e one.

However, it isn't really propblematic if God takes on different roles, or as Christians deem it, different prospons.

HOwever, while the role of Jesus has been to make himself the bearer of the fruits of human sins, the purpose of the Holy Spirit is to convict one of sin and lead them to Jesus, and also to be the proof of faith in Jesus.

However, if one gets baptized and he continues to engage in sin as a result of his nature, then, if he doesn't correct it, the HOly Spirit will leave. Meaning, one still has to maintain himself even when he has the Holy SPirit.

But if maintenance is still a necessity, what is the use of having a helper in the first pace? Why not repent like Jews do?
