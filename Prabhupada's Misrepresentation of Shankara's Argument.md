See here: https://vaniquotes.org/wiki/In_the_Mundaka_Upanisad_(1.1.7)_it_is_stated,_yathorna-nabhih_srjate_grhnate_ca:_%22(The_Lord_creates_and_destroys_the_cosmic_manifestation)_as_a_spider_creates_a_web_and_draws_it_back_within_itself%22

He says, after using the analogies from:
1. Brahma Soothra Verse 2 (janmādy asya yataḥ: “The Absolute Truth is the original source of everything.”), 
2. Bhagavad Geetha 10.8 (mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate: “From Me, everything emanates.”), 
3. Tattireeya Upanishad 3.1.1. (yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante. “The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born.”) and 
4. Mundaka Upanishad 1.1.7 (yathorṇa-nābhiḥ sṛjate gṛhṇate ca: “[The Lord creates and destroys the cosmic manifestation] as a spider creates a web and draws it back within itself.”),

he made the point that none of this is in line with Parinaama Vaada. So far, correct. But then he says:

> However, being very anxious to protect Śrīla Vyāsadeva from criticism, Śaṅkarācārya became a pseudo gentleman and put forward his theory of illusion (vivarta-vāda). Śaṅkarācārya concocted this meaning of pariṇāma-vāda, and by word jugglery he endeavored very hard to establish pariṇāma-vāda as vivarta-vāda.

When he equates Parinaama Vaada with Vivarta Vaada like this, it only shows he did not understand what Vivarta Vaada was. Basically it says (in the spider-web analogy) the spider is real, but the web is not.
