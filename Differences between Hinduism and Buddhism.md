The main difference in Hinduism and Buddhism is that, Hinduism says that there is a permanent ultimate consciousness, while Buddhism says that the world is fleeting. Advaita Vedanta Darshana too does agree with the idea that the world is fleeting, but that's one's identity is not in the world, but in the ultimate consciousness.

Another difference that arises from this is that, Buddhism considers the mind as fleeting. But even then, we are able to remember things, because through repetition, we retain ideas. And we are able to utilize these ideas to form new ideas later on. Buddhism does realize this, but considers this an unintentional happening.


Ultimate consciousness is a substance that can reflect its own radiance, because it all there is to reflect off of. But just as a circular mirror is not its own reflection, 

This analogy is mine, but it has been shown in Trika Shaivism, and some schools of Vedanta too. The idea of the world being the radiance of Brahmaan is common, especially in Vishishta Advaita, but also even in most dualistic religions. The idea of reflection is a less common idea in Advaita.

For another analogy, when a blind man touches himself, he feels himself. But this feeling is not him. This feeling allows him to recognize himself, yet it is not him.

But why can't the ultimate consciousness change the way in which it is touching itself?

Unlike humans with a mind and intentions, Brahmaan does not have a mind. Rather, it is the glow of Brahmaan as it is reflected on itself that is Maaya. Brahmaan is eternal, but the glow isn't.
