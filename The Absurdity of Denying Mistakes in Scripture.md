## In Hindu-ism
When the Puraanas contradict, they say that each story in a Puraana comes from another Kalpa (cycle of creation and destruction) which is slightly different from the present Kalpa.

I attribute this to Hindu-ism, as I do not view the Puraanas the same way as those who identify as Hindus see it.
## In Muhammad-ian-ity
They say that multiple version of the infallible Qur'aan exist because Allah revealed them to Muhammad in 7 rescensions.

# Funny Argument

If someone makes a stupid argument, we can say that they are reporting from a different timeline, and the present could've come about from a different timeline that appears similar.

If someone makes a misquotation by copy error, we could say that the true quotation existed in different timelines as different rescensions (since unlike Wahi Allah, this world is bound in causality), so all are equally valid.
