**Talmud, Sefer Nezikin, Makkot 1:10:**

- A court that executes once in 7 years is characterised as "destructive".
- Rabbi Elazar upped it to once in 70 years.
- Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva said, if they were in the Sanhedrin, no one would have ever been executed.

> מִי שֶׁנִּגְמַר דִּינוֹ וּבָרַח וּבָא לִפְנֵי אוֹתוֹ בֵית דִּין, אֵין סוֹתְרִים אֶת דִּינוֹ. כָּל מָקוֹם שֶׁיַּעַמְדוּ שְׁנַיִם וְיֹאמְרוּ, מְעִידִין אָנוּ בְאִישׁ פְּלוֹנִי שֶׁנִּגְמַר דִּינוֹ בְּבֵית דִּינוֹ שֶׁל פְּלוֹנִי, וּפְלוֹנִי וּפְלוֹנִי עֵדָיו, הֲרֵי זֶה יֵהָרֵג. סַנְהֶדְרִין נוֹהֶגֶת בָּאָרֶץ וּבְחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ. סַנְהֶדְרִין הַהוֹרֶגֶת אֶחָד בְּשָׁבוּעַ נִקְרֵאת חָבְלָנִית. רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה אוֹמֵר, אֶחָד לְשִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה. רַבִּי טַרְפוֹן וְרַבִּי עֲקִיבָא אוֹמְרִים, אִלּוּ הָיִינוּ בַסַּנְהֶדְרִין לֹא נֶהֱרַג אָדָם מֵעוֹלָם. רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אוֹמֵר, אַף הֵן מַרְבִּין שׁוֹפְכֵי דָמִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל:

> This mishna continues to discuss the matter of testimony in the case of one who is liable to be executed. Concerning **one whose verdict was delivered** and he was sentenced to death **and he fled, and he** then **came before the same court** that sentenced him, **they do not overturn his verdict** and retry him. Rather, the court administers the previous verdict. Consequently, in **any place where two** witnesses **will stand and say: We testify with regard to a man** called **so-and-so that his verdict was delivered** and he was sentenced to death **in the court of so-and-so, and so-and-so and so-and-so** were **his witnesses, that** person **shall be executed** on the basis of that testimony. The mishna continues: The mitzva to establish **a Sanhedrin** with the authority to administer capital punishments **is in effect** both **in Eretz** Yisrael **and outside Eretz** Yisrael. **A Sanhedrin that executes** a transgressor **once in seven years is characterized** as **a destructive** tribunal. Since the Sanhedrin would subject the testimony to exacting scrutiny, it was extremely rare for a defendant to be executed. **Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:** This categorization applies to a Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor **once in seventy years. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say: If we had been** members **of the Sanhedrin,** we would have conducted trials in a manner whereby **no person would have ever been executed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:** In adopting that approach, **they too** would **increase** the number of **murderers among the Jewish people.** The death penalty would lose its deterrent value, as all potential murderers would know that no one is ever executed.
