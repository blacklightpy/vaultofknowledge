# How Executions Must be Minimal

**Talmud, Sefer Nezikin, Makkot 1:10:**

- A court that executes once in 7 years is characterised as "destructive".
- Rabbi Elazar upped it to once in 70 years.
- Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva said, if they were in the Sanhedrin, no one would have ever been executed.

> מִי שֶׁנִּגְמַר דִּינוֹ וּבָרַח וּבָא לִפְנֵי אוֹתוֹ בֵית דִּין, אֵין סוֹתְרִים אֶת דִּינוֹ. כָּל מָקוֹם שֶׁיַּעַמְדוּ שְׁנַיִם וְיֹאמְרוּ, מְעִידִין אָנוּ בְאִישׁ פְּלוֹנִי שֶׁנִּגְמַר דִּינוֹ בְּבֵית דִּינוֹ שֶׁל פְּלוֹנִי, וּפְלוֹנִי וּפְלוֹנִי עֵדָיו, הֲרֵי זֶה יֵהָרֵג. סַנְהֶדְרִין נוֹהֶגֶת בָּאָרֶץ וּבְחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ. סַנְהֶדְרִין הַהוֹרֶגֶת אֶחָד בְּשָׁבוּעַ נִקְרֵאת חָבְלָנִית. רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה אוֹמֵר, אֶחָד לְשִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה. רַבִּי טַרְפוֹן וְרַבִּי עֲקִיבָא אוֹמְרִים, אִלּוּ הָיִינוּ בַסַּנְהֶדְרִין לֹא נֶהֱרַג אָדָם מֵעוֹלָם. רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אוֹמֵר, אַף הֵן מַרְבִּין שׁוֹפְכֵי דָמִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל:
> 
> This mishna continues to discuss the matter of testimony in the case of one who is liable to be executed. Concerning **one whose verdict was delivered** and he was sentenced to death **and he fled, and he** then **came before the same court** that sentenced him, **they do not overturn his verdict** and retry him. Rather, the court administers the previous verdict. Consequently, in **any place where two** witnesses **will stand and say: We testify with regard to a man** called **so-and-so that his verdict was delivered** and he was sentenced to death **in the court of so-and-so, and so-and-so and so-and-so** were **his witnesses, that** person **shall be executed** on the basis of that testimony. The mishna continues: The mitzva to establish **a Sanhedrin** with the authority to administer capital punishments **is in effect** both **in Eretz** Yisrael **and outside Eretz** Yisrael. **A Sanhedrin that executes** a transgressor **once in seven years is characterized** as **a destructive** tribunal. Since the Sanhedrin would subject the testimony to exacting scrutiny, it was extremely rare for a defendant to be executed. **Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:** This categorization applies to a Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor **once in seventy years. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say: If we had been** members **of the Sanhedrin,** we would have conducted trials in a manner whereby **no person would have ever been executed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:** In adopting that approach, **they too** would **increase** the number of **murderers among the Jewish people.** The death penalty would lose its deterrent value, as all potential murderers would know that no one is ever executed.

# The Conditions of Execution

**Mishneh Torah by Maimonaides, Sefer Shoftim (Judges), Sanhedrin, Chapter 12, 1-3:**

- A person has to first be warned of the punishment, whether he is Torah scholar or a common person, and he has to acknowledge it, and not just say that he knows there is a punishment. (Even if he says: "I know," he is not liable for punishment until he accepts death upon himself, saying: "It is for this reason that I am doing this." In such a situation, he is executed.)
- He must commit the crime directly after the warning, or else a warning should be issued again.
- It is because when you kill a person, you kill his entire descendants, and it is from this that it is derived that if you kill a soul, it's as though you killed an entire world, and if you saved a soul, you saved and entire world.
- If all the witness testimonies are accurate, the person is informed that if he did not transgress, it is not necessary to fear their words, and is judged, and if there is grounds for acquittal, he is released. If not, he is incarcerated for a day.
- That day, the judges eat little and drink no wine, and debate the topic throughout the night, and then in the morning, presents all their updated opinions in the Beis Din (Rabbinical Court).
- All their rationales are recorded, and it is seen in the "drisha v'chakira" at the Beis Din (Rabbinical Court) if he can be acquitted, he is acquitted, or else, he is immediately executed.

> 
> How are cases involving capital punishment judged? When the witnesses come to the court and say: "We saw this person violate such-and-such a transgression," the judges ask them: "Do you recognize him? Did you give him a warning?"
> 
> If they answer: "We do not recognize him," "We are unsure of his identity," or "We did not warn him," the defendant is exonerated.

> 
> Both a Torah scholar and a common person need a warning, for the obligation for a warning was instituted only to make a distinction between a person who transgresses inadvertently and one who transgresses intentionally, lest the person say: "I transgressed inadvertently."  
> 
> How is a warning administered? We tell him: "Desist..." or "Do not do it. It is a transgression and you are liable to be executed by the court..." or "to receive lashes for it." If he ceases, he is not liable. Similarly, if he remains silent or nods his head, he is not liable for punishment. Even if he says: "I know," he is not liable for punishment until he accepts death upon himself, saying: "It is for this reason that I am doing this." In such a situation, he is executed.  
> 
> He must commit the transgression directly after receiving the warning, within the time to offer a salutation. If he waits longer than that, a second warning is necessary.  
> 
> The warning is acceptable whether it was administered by one of the witnesses or by another individual, even a woman or a servant. Even if the transgressor hears the voice of the person administering the warning, but does not see him, and even if he himself administers the warning, he should be executed.

> 
> If the witnesses say: "He was given a warning and we recognize him," the court intimidates them.  
> How do they intimidate them in cases involving capital punishment? They say: "Maybe you are speaking on the basis of supposition, or on the basis of hearsay, one witness from another witness, or maybe you heard from a trustworthy person?" "Maybe you do not know that ultimately we will subject you to questions and crossexamination?"  
> 
> "Know that cases involving capital punishment do not resemble those involving financial matters. With regard to financial matters, if there is any deceit, a person can make financial restitution and receive atonement. With regard to capital punishment, the victim's blood and the blood of his unborn descendants are dependent on the murderer until eternity. As it is said with regard to Cain, 'The voice of the blood of your brother is crying out.' The Torah uses the plural form of the word blood, implying his blood and the blood of his descendants.  
> 
> "For this reason, man was created alone in the world. This teaches us that a person who eliminates one soul from the world is considered as if he eliminated an entire world. Conversely, a person who saves one soul is considered as if he saved an entire world.  
> 
> "All the inhabitants of the world are created in the image of Adam, the first man, and yet no one person's face resembles the face of his colleague. Therefore each person can say: 'The world was created for me.'  
> "If you might say: 'Why should we enter this difficulty?' It is written Leviticus 5:1: 'If he witnessed, observed, or knew....' If you will say: 'Why should we become responsible for shedding the defendant's blood? It is already said: 'At the destruction of the wicked, there is joy. '  
> 
> If they stand by their word, the witness of the greater stature is brought into the court alone and he is questioned and cross-examined, as will be explained in _Hilchot Edut_. If his testimony appears to be factual, the second witness is brought into the court, and he is questioned as the first one was. Even if there are 100 witnesses, each one is questioned and cross-examined.  
> 
> If the testimony of all the witnesses is accurate, we begin the judgment with a statement that tends to acquittal as stated. We tell him: "If you did not transgress, do not fear their words." Then we judge him. If grounds for acquittal are found, he is released. If they do not find grounds for acquittal, the defendant is imprisoned until the following day.  
> 
> On that day, the _Sanhedrin_ divides itself into pairs and they examine the judgment. They eat little and do not drink wine throughout that entire day. They debate the matter throughout the night, each one with his comrade or alone. On the morrow, they come to the court early. Each of those who voted for acquittal state: "I am the one who voted for acquittal yesterday, and I still favor that ruling." Each of those who voted for conviction state: "I am the one who voted for conviction yesterday, and I still favor that ruling," or "...I have changed my mind and I vote for acquittal." If they erred in that regard, or did not know who voted for conviction or who voted for acquittal on the basis of one rationale and hence are considered only as one, as we explained, the two scribes of the court remind them, for they write down the rationale given by each one of them.  
> 
> We begin the judgment. If they find a rationale to acquit him, they acquit him. If it is necessary to add judges, they add. If there is a majority of judges who seek to convict him, and he is convicted, he is taken out to be executed immediately.  
> 
> The place where the court conducts the execution is outside the court and removed from it, as implied by Leviticus 24:14: "Take the blasphemer outside the camp...." It appears to me that it should be approximately 6 _mil_ , the distance between the court of Moses our teacher which was before the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and the extremities of the camp of the Jewish people.

> 
> Both witnesses in cases involving capital punishment must see the person committing the transgression at the same time. They must deliver their testimony together, in the same court. These requirements do not apply with regard to cases involving financial matters.  
> 
> What is implied? If while looking from one window, a witness saw the person commit the transgression and the other witness saw him from the other window, their testimonies can be combined if they see each other. If they cannot see each other, their testimonies cannot be combined. If a person who administered the warning sees the witnesses and the witnesses see him, because of the person administering the warning, their testimony is combined even though they do not see each other.  
> 
> If they do not see the transgression at the same time, their testimony is not combined. For example, the two witnesses were in one house and one stuck his head out of the window and saw a person perform a forbidden labor on the Sabbath and another person issue a warning. He then thrust in his head and the other witness stuck his head out of the same window and saw the person commit the transgression. Their testimonies cannot be combined unless they both see the transgression at the same time.  
> 
> The following laws apply when two witnesses see the transgressor from one window, two other witnesses see him from another window, and there is a person who gives a warning in between. If some of them see each other, they are considered as one group of witnesses. If they do not see each other and the person giving the warning does not include them together, they are considered as two groups of witnesses. Therefore if one group are discovered to be _zomamim_, the transgressor and the witnesses are executed. For the transgressor is executed on the basis of the testimony of the second group of witnesses.
# Dealing with Serial Killers

They are the ones who are known to be killers, but there are no legally valid witnesses, although the truth is clear. They are "indirectly" executed by sending them to a Kippah.

**Sanhedrin 81b, 1-4:**

He is put in a Kippah (small chamber) and is fed sparing bread and scant water until his intestines explode.

> **מַתְנִי׳** הַהוֹרֵג נֶפֶשׁ שֶׁלֹּא בְּעֵדִים, מַכְנִיסִין אוֹתוֹ לַכִּיפָּה וּמַאֲכִילִין אוֹתוֹ לֶחֶם צָר וּמַיִם לָחַץ.
> 
> **MISHNA:** With regard to **one who kills a person not in** the presence of **witnesses** and it is impossible to judge him in court, the court **places him into a vaulted chamber and feeds him sparing bread and scant water** (see Isaiah 30:20).
> 
> **גְּמָ׳** מְנָא יָדְעִינַן? אָמַר רַב: בְּעֵדוּת מְיוּחֶדֶת. וּשְׁמוּאֵל אָמַר: שֶׁלֹּא בְּהַתְרָאָה.
> 
> **GEMARA:** The Gemara asks: If there are no witnesses, **from where do we know** that he killed a person and is liable to be punished? **Rav says:** The _tanna_ of the mishna is speaking **about** a case of **disjointed testimony,** where the witnesses were not together and they witnessed the murder from different vantage points. The court cannot convict a person for committing a murder based on that type of testimony even though it is clear that the witnesses are telling the truth. **And Shmuel says:** The _tanna_ of the mishna is speaking about a case **where** the witnesses testified that they witnessed the murder but there was **no forewarning,** and therefore the court cannot convict him.
> 
> וְרַב חִסְדָּא אָמַר אֲבִימִי: כְּגוֹן דְּאִיתַּכְחוּשׁ בִּבְדִיקוֹת וְלָא אִיתַּכְחוּשׁ בַּחֲקִירוֹת, כְּדִתְנַן: מַעֲשֶׂה וּבָדַק בֶּן זַכַּאי בְּעוּקְצֵי תְאֵנִים.
> 
> **And Rav Ḥisda** says that **Avimi says:** The _tanna_ of the mishna is speaking of a case **where** the witnesses **contradicted** each other **in the examinations** that involve matters peripheral to the murder **but did not contradict** each other **in the interrogations,** which are integral to the murder, i.e., time and place. Therefore, it is clear to the court that the accused is guilty and consequently they place him in the vaulted chamber. **As we learned** in a mishna (40a): There was **an incident and ben Zakkai examined** the witnesses **with regard to the stems of figs** on the fig tree beneath which the murder took place. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai questioned the witnesses about the thickness of the stems in order to determine whether they would contradict each other in this peripheral detail in order to save the accused (see 41a).

> The mishna teaches: **And feeds him sparing bread and scant water.** The Gemara asks: **What is different** in the mishna **here that** the _tanna_ **teaches** that the court **gives him sparing bread and scant water** in the vaulted chamber, **and what is different** in the previous mishna **there that** the _tanna_ **teaches** that the court **feeds him barley** bread **until his belly ruptures;** are these two different punishments? **Rav Sheshet says:** Both **this and that** are one punishment; first, the court **gives him sparing bread and scant water until his intestines contract** due to his starvation diet, **and then** the court **feeds him barley** bread that expands in his innards **until his belly ruptures.**

**Mishneh Torah by Maimonaides, Sefer Nezikim, Rotzeach (Murder and The Preservation of Life), 4, 8:**

> הַהוֹרֵג נְפָשׁוֹת וְלֹא הָיוּ עֵדִים רוֹאִין אוֹתוֹ כְּאַחַת אֶלָּא רָאָהוּ הָאֶחָד אַחַר הָאֶחָד אוֹ שֶׁהָרַג בִּפְנֵי שְׁנֵי עֵדִים בְּלֹא הַתְרָאָה אוֹ שֶׁהֻכְחֲשׁוּ הָעֵדִים בִּבְדִיקוֹת וְלֹא הֻכְחֲשׁוּ בַּחֲקִירוֹת. כָּל אֵלּוּ הָרַצְחָנִים כּוֹנְסִין אוֹתָן לְכִפָּה וּמַאֲכִילִין אוֹתָן לֶחֶם צַר וּמַיִם לַחַץ עַד שֶׁיָּצֵרוּ מֵעֵיהֶן וְאַחַר כָּךְ מַאֲכִילִין אוֹתָן שְׂעוֹרִים עַד שֶׁתִּבָּקַע כְּרֵסָם מִכֹּבֶד הַחלִי:
> 
> The following laws apply when a person kills people, but the witnesses did not observe his act together - instead one saw him after the other did: a person killed in the presence of witnesses, but a warning was not given; or the witnesses to a murder contradicted each other with regard to the fine points of the testimony, but not with regard to the fundamental questions.  
> 
> All those murderers should be forced to enter a _kipah_.There they are fed parched bread and small amounts of water until their digestive tract contracts. Then they are fed barley until their bellies burst because of the extent of the sickness and they die.

### Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai sentencing a false witness to death who was not to be punished, by a wrong understanding

**Seder Moed, Chagigah, 16b, 3-7:**

> מַאן תְּנָא לְהָא דְּתָנוּ רַבָּנַן: אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוּדָה בֶּן טָבַאי: אֶרְאֶה בְּנֶחָמָה אִם לֹא הָרַגְתִּי עֵד זוֹמֵם, לְהוֹצִיא מִלִּבָּן שֶׁל צַדּוּקִין. שֶׁהָיוּ אוֹמְרִים: אֵין עֵדִים זוֹמְמִין נֶהֱרָגִין עַד שֶׁיֵּהָרֵג הַנִּידּוֹן.
> 
> The Gemara asks: **Who is the _tanna_** who taught **that which the Sages taught** in a _baraita_: **Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai said:** I swear that **I will** not **see the consolation** of Israel **if I did not kill a conspiring witness.** This means that Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai sentenced a conspiring witness to death, in order **to counter the views of the Sadducees, who would say: Conspiring witnesses are not executed unless the sentenced one has been executed.** Their views opposed the traditional view, which maintains that conspiring witnesses are executed only if the one sentenced by their testimony has not yet been executed.
> 
> אָמַר לוֹ שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן שָׁטַח: אֶרְאֶה בְּנֶחָמָה אִם לֹא שָׁפַכְתָּ דָּם נָקִי, שֶׁהֲרֵי אָמְרוּ חֲכָמִים: אֵין עֵדִים זוֹמְמִין נֶהֱרָגִין עַד שֶׁיִּזּוֹמּוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם, וְאֵין לוֹקִין עַד שֶׁיִּזּוֹמּוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם, וְאֵין מְשַׁלְּמִין מָמוֹן עַד שֶׁיִּזּוֹמּוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם.
> 
> **Shimon ben Shataḥ said to him:** I swear that **I will** not **see the consolation** of Israel **if you did not shed innocent blood, as the Sages said: Conspiring witnesses are not executed unless they are both found to be conspirators;** if only one is found to be a conspirator, he is not executed. **And they are not flogged** if they are liable to such a penalty, **unless they are both found to be conspirators. And** if they testified falsely that someone owed money, **they do not pay money unless they are both found to be conspirators.**
> 
> מִיָּד קִבֵּל עָלָיו יְהוּדָה בֶּן טָבַאי שֶׁאֵינוֹ מוֹרֶה הֲלָכָה אֶלָּא בִּפְנֵי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן שָׁטַח.
> 
> Hearing this, **Yehuda ben Tabbai immediately accepted upon himself not to rule** on any matter of **law unless he was in the presence of Shimon ben Shataḥ,** as he realized he could not rely on his own judgment.
> 
> כׇּל יָמָיו שֶׁל יְהוּדָה בֶּן טָבַאי הָיָה מִשְׁתַּטֵּחַ עַל קִבְרוֹ שֶׁל אוֹתוֹ הָרוּג, וְהָיָה קוֹלוֹ נִשְׁמָע. כִּסְבוּרִין הָעָם לוֹמַר שֶׁקּוֹלוֹ שֶׁל הָרוּג הוּא. אָמַר לָהֶם: קוֹלִי הוּא. תֵּדְעוּ, שֶׁלְּמָחָר הוּא מֵת, וְאֵין קוֹלוֹ נִשְׁמָע.
> 
> The _baraita_ further relates: **All of Yehuda ben Tabbai’s days, he would prostrate himself on the grave of that executed** individual, to request forgiveness, **and his voice was heard** weeping. **The people thought that it was the voice of that executed** person, rising from his grave. Yehuda ben Tabbai **said to them: It is my voice,** and **you** shall **know** that it is so, **for tomorrow,** i.e., sometime in the future, **he will die, and his voice will no** longer **be heard.** Yehuda ben Tabbai was referring to himself, but he did not want to mention something negative about himself in direct terms.
> 
> אֲמַר לֵיהּ רַב אַחָא בְּרֵיהּ דְּרָבָא לְרַב אָשֵׁי: וְדִלְמָא פַּיּוֹסֵי פַּיְּיסֵיהּ, אוֹ בְּדִינָא תַּבְעֵיהּ.
> 
> **Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:** This provides no conclusive proof that the voice was not that of the executed man, as **perhaps** ben Tabbai **appeased** the executed individual in the World-to-Come. **Or,** alternatively, the latter may have **prosecuted him by the law** of Heaven, and that is why his voice can no longer be heard.

**Seder Nezikin, Makkot, 5b, 17-20:**

> תַּנְיָא, אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוּדָה בֶּן טָבַאי: אֶרְאֶה בְּנֶחָמָה אִם לֹא הָרַגְתִּי עֵד זוֹמֵם לְהוֹצִיא מִלִּבָּן שֶׁל צַדּוּקִים. שֶׁהָיוּ אוֹמְרִים: אֵין הָעֵדִים זוֹמְמִין נֶהֱרָגִין עַד שֶׁיֵּהָרֵג הַנִּדּוֹן.
> 
> § Apropos the dispute between the Sadducees and the Sages, **it is taught** in a _baraita_: **Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai says** in the form of an oath: **I will** not **see the** future **consolation** of the Jewish people **if I did not** as a member of the court **kill** a single **conspiring witness,** in order **to eradicate** this reasoning **from the hearts of the Sadducees, who would say: The conspiring witnesses are executed only** if they are rendered conspiring witnesses after the accused **will be killed.** Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai killed the conspiring witness while the accused remained alive.
> 
> אָמַר לוֹ שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן שָׁטַח: אֶרְאֶה בְּנֶחָמָה אִם לֹא שָׁפַכְתָּ דָּם נָקִי, שֶׁהֲרֵי אָמְרוּ חֲכָמִים: אֵין הָעֵדִים זוֹמְמִין נֶהֱרָגִין עַד שֶׁיִּזּוֹמּוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם, וְאֵין לוֹקִין עַד שֶׁיִּזּוֹמּוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם.
> 
> **Shimon ben Shataḥ said to him: I will** not **see the consolation** of the Jewish people **if you did not shed** thereby **innocent blood, as the Sages said: Conspiring witnesses are not executed unless both of them are rendered conspiring** witnesses, **and they are not flogged unless both of them are rendered conspiring** witnesses. In this case, only one was rendered a conspiring witness.
> 
> מִיָּד קִבֵּל עָלָיו רַבִּי יְהוּדָה בֶּן טָבַאי שֶׁאֵינוֹ מוֹרֶה הוֹרָאָה אֶלָּא לִפְנֵי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן שָׁטַח. וְכׇל יָמָיו שֶׁל רַבִּי יְהוּדָה בֶּן טָבַאי הָיָה מִשְׁתַּטֵּחַ עַל קִבְרוֹ שֶׁל אוֹתוֹ הָעֵד, וְהָיָה קוֹלוֹ נִשְׁמָע, וְכִסְבוּרִין הָעָם לוֹמַר: קוֹלוֹ שֶׁל הָרוּג. אָמַר: קוֹלִי שֶׁלִּי הוּא, תֵּדְעוּ – לְמָחָר הוּא מֵת, אֵין קוֹלוֹ נִשְׁמָע.
> 
> **Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai immediately accepted** a commitment **upon himself that he would issue a halakhic ruling only** when he was **before Shimon ben Shataḥ,** to avoid mistakes in the future. **And** throughout **all of Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai’s days he would** tearfully **prostrate himself on the grave of that witness** whom he executed, to request forgiveness for having done so, **and his voice was heard** from a distance. **And the people thought to say** that it was **the voice of** the **executed** witness that was heard. Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai **said** to them: **It is my voice. Know** that this is so, as **tomorrow,** i.e., sometime in the future, **he,** referring to himself, **will die,** and **his voice will no** longer **be heard.**
> 
> אֲמַר לֵיהּ רַב אַחָא בְּרֵיהּ דְּרָבָא לְרַב אָשֵׁי: דִּלְמָא בְּדִינָא קָם בַּהֲדֵיהּ, אִי נָמֵי פַּיּוֹסֵי פַּיְּיסֵיהּ.
> 
> **Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:** The fact that the voice will cease after Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai’s death is inconclusive as proof that the voice is not that of the executed witness. **Perhaps** the reason that the voice of the executed person will no longer be heard is that **he confronted** Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai **in trial** before the heavenly court, obviating the need for crying from his grave. **Alternatively,** perhaps Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai **appeased** the executed witness in the World-to-Come, and there is silence because no grievances remained.

- Shimon ben Shatach and his court executing eighty women for practicing witchcraft ([Sanhedrin 45b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.45b.20-21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), and more details in [Rashi ibid. 45b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.45b.21?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Sanhedrin.45b.21.1&lang2=bi), from Yerushalmi Chagigah 2:2 and Sanhedrin 6:6) (Mass kill)
- ...and then having his own son convicted (based on false testimony) and executed ([Rashi ibid. 44b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.44b.13?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Sanhedrin.44b.13.3&lang2=bi), from Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 6:3) (own son)
- Someone being executed "in the days of the Greeks" for riding a horse on Shabbos ([Yevamos 90b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.90b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), [Sanhedrin 46a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.46a.11-12?lang=bi)) (Greek law was valid, but people were lazy with the mitzvot at the time)
- Yeshu Hanotzri, also known as Ben Stada and Ben Pandira, who was executed on Erev Pesach ([Sanhedrin 43a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.43a.20-21?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en) and 67b, uncensored editions). A lot of ink has been spilled on the question of whether this person is identical with the founder of Christianity.
- The _mekallel_ at the end of Parshat Emor (see: [Vayikra 24:10-16](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10-16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), and [23](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en))  
- The _mekosheish etzim_ in Parshat Shelach (see: [Bamidbar 15:32-36](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.35-36?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en))
- On [Gittin 57a](http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=gitin&daf=57a&go=Go) a father and son are put to death for sleeping with a betrothed young woman on yom kippur. 
- The words 'a father and son... Yom kippur' are used again in [Bava Metzia 83b](http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=bava_metzia&daf=83b)

**Seder Nezikin, Sanhedrin 71a, 15:**

> אִיבָּעֵית אֵימָא: רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן הִיא, דְּתַנְיָא, אָמַר רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן: וְכִי מִפְּנֵי שֶׁאָכַל זֶה תַּרְטֵימָר בָּשָׂר וְשָׁתָה חֲצִי לוֹג יַיִן הָאִיטַלְקִי, אָבִיו וְאִמּוֹ מוֹצִיאִין אוֹתוֹ לְסׇקְלוֹ? אֶלָּא לֹא הָיָה וְלֹא עָתִיד לִהְיוֹת, וְלָמָּה נִכְתַּב? דְּרוֹשׁ וְקַבֵּל שָׂכָר. אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹנָתָן: אֲנִי רְאִיתִיו וְיָשַׁבְתִּי עַל קִבְרוֹ.
> 
> **If you wish, say** instead that this _baraita_ **is** in accordance with the opinion of **Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught** in a _baraita_ that **Rabbi Shimon says: And is it** simply **due to** the fact **that** the boy **ate a _tarteimar_ of meat and drank a half-_log_ of Italian wine** that **his father and his mother shall take him out to stone him? Rather, there has never been** a stubborn and rebellious son **and there will never be** one **in the future. And why,** then, **was** the passage relating to a stubborn and rebellious son **written** in the Torah? So that **you may expound** upon new understandings of the Torah **and receive reward** for your learning. **Rabbi Yonatan says:** This is not so, as **I saw** one. I was once in a place where a stubborn and rebellious son was condemned to death, **and I** even **sat on his grave** after he was executed.

### Execution of an idolatrous city

**Seder Nezikin, Sanhedrin 71a, 17 (Destruction of an Idolatrous City):**

> מַאי טַעְמָא? אָמַר קְרָא: ״וְאֶת כׇּל שְׁלָלָהּ תִּקְבֹּץ אֶל תּוֹךְ רְחֹבָהּ וְשָׂרַפְתָּ בָאֵשׁ״. וְכֵיוָן דְּאִי אִיכָּא מְזוּזָה, לָא אֶפְשָׁר, דִּכְתִיב: ״לֹא תַעֲשׂוּן כֵּן לַה׳ אֱלֹהֵיכֶם״. אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹנָתָן: אֲנִי רְאִיתִיהָ וְיָשַׁבְתִּי עַל תִּילָּהּ.
> 
> The Gemara asks: **What is the reason** that a city that has even one _mezuza_ cannot become an idolatrous city? The Gemara answers: **The verse states: “And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the open space of the city, and shall burn with fire** both the city and the entire plunder taken in it” (Deuteronomy 13:17). **And since if there is a _mezuza_** there **it is impossible** to burn all the contents of the city, **as it is written:** “And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their _asherim_ with fire…**This you shall not do so to the Lord your God”** (Deuteronomy 12:3–4). It is derived from this verse that it is prohibited to destroy a sacred item such as a _mezuza_. Therefore, in a city that has even one _mezuza_, it is impossible to fulfill the _halakhot_ of an idolatrous city, as not all of its contents may be burned. **Rabbi Yonatan says:** This is not so, as **I** once **saw** an idolatrous city that was condemned to destruction, **and I** even **sat on its ruins.**
