Coffee is a cherry fruit. Green coffe beans are the raw seeds which are processed and roasted to a certain taste profile before they are used to make the coffee drink.

## Starbucks Coffee
They basically have hot/cold coffee/tea/drinks, and then Frappuccino blends.

Basically they are either of the main coffee types with flavour variations (except for the Nitrogen infusion I found, in the Nitro variants).

Also some names are Spanish (eg. "Con Panna" means "with cream).
### Frappuccino (Blended Beverages)
They are Coffee or cream base drinks, blended with ice and syrups, topped with whipped cream and/or spices.

It may also include blended Starbucks cold drinks.
It is also high in sugar.
#### Frappuccino Flavours
- Mocha
- Vanilla
- Coffee
- Toasted White Chocolate Mocha
- Pumpkin Spice
- Caramel
# Ingredients
**Note:** What's on the market maybe pre-grounded coffee, and I found that most are not either Arabica or Robusta, but rather a mix of both. Starbucks does the same thing, but with better descriptions.
## Coffee Beans
- Arabica Coffee Beans (Smooth, Less Bitter)
- Robusta Coffee Beans (Strong, Caffeine-Rich)
### Available as
- Whole Beans (Unroasted / Roasted to a degree; for fresh/customized grinding)
- Ground Coffee (Coarse, Medium, Fine, Extra-fine)
- Instant Coffee (Soluble, extracted after brewing and evaporating water)
## Syrup
- (Recipes are free, or you can get from store)
	- Basically boil sugar + water (+flavour bean) then heat for 5 min and cool it
# Equipment
### Brewing Equipment
- French Press (For flavour-rich cup of coffee)
- Espresso Machine (For espressos)
- Pour-over / Drip Coffee Maker (Purer Taste, water flows over coffee beans)

> [!NOTE]
> Most countries seem to either pour hot water over filter or percolate, but in India we add coffee to hot water, then filter and then percolate for uniformly distributing the taste.
