Denominations are also called Sampradayas. (I guess Darshanas should be moved to a separate note.)
# Based on Schools of thought
Schools of thought are also called Darshanas.

Notes: https://www.omyogashala.in/shad-darshan

The schools are divided on the basis of whether they believe in the Veda-s or not. The ones that believe in the Veda-s are called Aastika (there is) and the others are called Naastika (there isn't). Some say that the definition is based on whether there is a soul or not, but the common definition is based on the acceptance of the Veda-s.
## Orthodox Schools

There are six schools of thought, called the Sadh-Darshanas (Six Schools). They are themselves grouped into three groups of two similar schools, as follows:

1. Sankhya and Yoga
2. Nyaaya and Vaisheshika
3. Meemaamsa and Vedaanta

They can be grouped as:
- Haithuka (Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaaya, Vaisheshika)
	- Haithuka comes from the word Hethu, meaning "Reason"
	- They prefer reason to scripture
- Smarta (Meemaamsa, Vedaanta)
	- Smarta comes from the word Smriti
	- Smriti asserts the importance of Shruti

### Detailed Description

- 1. Saankhya (Enumeration)
	- **Brief**
		- It is a discrete school of thought that explains reality as evolving due to **Prakriti** (Nature)
		- It views **Purusha** (Witness Consciousness) as the centres of consciousness, and the universe as consisting of both **Purusha** and **Prakriti**
		- Actually, there are many **Purushas** who share one **Prakriti**
		- Hence it is kind of dualistic (separation of mind and matter), discrete and atheistic
	- **Differences with Dualism**
		- Western [[Dualism]] focuses on the difference between "mind" and "body"
		- Saankhya Darshana focuses on the difference between the "witness consciousness" and the "physical world", which includes the outside nature, one's feelings and sensations
		- The main difference being, "mind" in Dualism considers the mind of an individual person, but "witness consciousness" in Sankhya considers only one observer to the entire world, and "body" in Dualism refers to to a person's body, while the "physical world" encompasses one's body, sensations and the surroundings.
			- This is closer to the idea of "Brain in a Vat", except without a physical Brain or Vat.
			- I guess I'll fix this idea by adding nuances between monism and dualism in their relevant pages
	- **Foundational Texts**
		- Saankhya Soothras by Kapila Maharshi (lost)
		- Saankhya Karika by Eeshvara Krishna (4th-5th Century CE)
	- **Metaphysics**
		- **Purusa** is not actually a part of **Prakriti**
		- Purusa misidentifies itself as being a part of Prakriti as a **Jiva**
		- **Moksha** is how the soul is liberated
	- **Epistemology**
		- Knowledge is possible through three **Pramaanas** (Means):
			- Veda (Sanskrit Books of Knowledge) [Primary Pramaana for Dharma]
			- **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception)
			- **Anumaana** (Logical Inference)
			- **Shabda** (Verbal Testimony)
	- **General Description**
		- Evolution of Nature
			- Nature evolves for the sake of the Soul in bondage (due to ignorance).
			- A free Soul simply witnesses the evolution, but he misidentifies himself as being a part of it.
			- When the Soul realizes that it is distinct from Nature and that it cannot evolve, Nature also stops evolving for that Soul.
			- **Moksha** (Liberation) is the natural goal of every Soul.
		- Cause and Effect
			- The Saankhya Darshana is based on **Sat-Kaarya Vaada** (Proposition that Effects are Existent)
				- The effect is pre-existent in the cause, so nothing new is ever created
				- Definition as in Advaita Vedaanta (a different Darshana)
					- The effect seems distinct from the cause due to an illusion, or Maya
					- Maya has two powers (an idea from Vedanta, but applies here)
						- **Avarna** (Veiling)
						- **Vikshepa** (Projection)
				- The effect is not a material change in Prakriti, but is a transformation of it (think matrix transformations)
			- Saankhya Darshana explains Sat-Kaarya Vaada based on Prakriti-Parinama Vaada (Proposition of Transformation of Nature)
		- Cosmic Evolution
			- According to Saankhya, Nature is the source of the world becoming
			- Nature is pure potentiality that evolves into 24 **Tattvas** (Fundamental Elements)
			- The evolution happens due to tensions of the three **Gunas** (Traits) of Nature
				- **Sattva** - Balance and Equilibrium (e.g. Poise, Fineness, Lightness, Illumination, Joy)
					- It is **Prakashashil** (Illuminating)
				- **Rajas** - Expansion or Activity (e.g. Dynamism, Activity, Excitation, Pain)
					- It is **Kriyaashil** (Dynamic)
				- **Tamas** - Inertia or Resistance to Action (e.g. Coarseness, Heaviness, Obstruction, Sloth)
					- It is **Avarnashil** (Blinding)
			- When the three traits are in **Samyaavastha** (Equilibrium), Nature is in **Pralayaavastha** (Destroyed / Uncreated State), and there are no **Tattvas** here.
			- The evolution begins once again during **Srishti** (Creation)
			- The 24 Tattvas that the world evolves into are:
				- **Prakriti**: The absolute potentiality.
				- **Antahkarana** (Inner Instruments)
					- **Mahat / Buddhi / Chittha** (Intelligence): The first product of cosmic evolution. This gives rise to intellect in living beings.
					- **Ahamkara** (Ego Sense): The second product of evolution. This is responsible for self-sense in living beings.
					- **Manas** (Instinctive Mind): It evolves from the Sattva aspect of Ahamkara.
				- **Pancha Jnana Indriya** (Five Sense Organs):
					- They evolve from the Sattva aspect of Ahamkara.
					- They are the Ears, Skin, Eyes, Tongue and Nose.
				- **Pancha Karma Indriya** (Five Organs of Action):
					- They too evolve from the Sattva aspect of Ahamkara.
					- They are the Hands, Legs, Vocal Apparatus, Urino-Genital Organ and Anus.
				- **Pancha Tan Matras** (Five Subtle Elements):
					- They evolve from the Tamas aspect of Ahamkaara.
					- They are the root energies of Sound (**Shabda**), Touch (**Sparsha**), Form (**Roopa**), Taste (**Rasa**) and Smell (**Gandha**).
				- **Pancha Maha Bhuta** (Five Great Substances):
					- They too evolve from the Tamas aspect of Ahamkara.
					- Earth (**Prithvi**), Air (**Vaayu**), Fire (**Agni**), Water (**Jala**) and Ether (**Aakasha**).
					- This is the visible aspect of the Physical Universe.
	- **Glossary of Terms**
		- Samsaara (Cyclic Existence)
		- Kaalachakra (The Cycle of Samsara)
		- Avidya (Ignorance)
		- Moksha (Liberation)
		- Manas (Mind)
		- Buddhi (Intellect)
		- Ahamkaara (Ego)

	- **Arguments against God by Sankhya philosophers**
		- If the existence of Karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without Karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of Karma, then Karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
		- Even if Karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Saankhya Darshana, is an attribute of Prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Saankhya Darshana, also confirms this notion.
		- Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Saankhya's notion of higher self.
		- Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of Prakriti as the origin of the world, not God.
	- Therefore, Saankhya maintained that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God.

- 2. Yoga (Connection with Reality)
	- **Brief**
		- It is based on the Saankhya school of thought
		- It derives ontology and epistemology from Saankhya, but adds the concept of Eeshvara (God)
	- **Foundational Texts**
		- Yoga Soothras of Patanjali (Main) (1st century AD)
			- **Sections**
				- Samadhi Pada (Chapter on Samadhi)
				- Sadhana Pada (Chapter on Practice)
				- Vibhuti Pada (Chapter on Power)
				- Kaivalya Pada (Chapter on Isolation, i.e. Liberation)

									- List
										- Shaucha (Purity and Clarity of Mind, Speech and Body)
									    - Santosha (Contentment)
									    - Tapas (Perseverance)

							- Yoga Sutras of Patanjali 2.1 describes three types of kriya (action):
								- **Verse:** <span style="font-size:145%">योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥</span>
								- **Trans:** yogash-chitta-vritthi-nirodhaḥ.
								- **Translation:** "Yoga is the inhibition (Nirodha) of the modifications (Vritthi) of the mind (Chittha)"
								- **Meaning:** The yoga of action (Kriya Yoga) is: asceticism (tapas), recitation (svadhyaya), and devotion (pranidhana) to Ishvara (the lord).
							- The steps are contained in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 Verses 1-27, Chapter 3 except Verse 54 and Chapter 4
						- It is just the second limb of the Ashtaanga Yoga
		- Yoga Bhaashya
		- Yoga Vasishta (Some consider this to be a Buddhist influenced interpolation)
		- Bhagavad Geetha
	- **Metaphysics**
		- Asmita (Not Smiling / Masked / Egoism due to identification of Purusha with Buddhi), is a Klesham (Affliction) that obstructs one from Yoga
	- **Epistemology**
		- Knowledge is possible through three **Pramanas** (Means):
			- Veda (Sanskrit Books of Knowledge) [Primary Pramaana for Dharma]
			- **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception)
			- **Anumaana** (Logical Inference)
			- **Shabda** (Verbal Testimony)
	- **General Description**
		- Cosmic Evolution
			- This is the same as in Sankhya, but the **Antahkarana** is comprised only of Buddhi, Ahamkara and Manas.
			- Chittha is used to refer to all four - Buddhi, Ahamkara, Manas and Chittha - in a western sense of the "mind"
		- Liberation
			- One can achieve Kaivalya (State of Liberation) by having the right understandings, practices and being blissful.
		- Concepts
			- Bhumi (Stages)
				- **Kshipta** (Disturbed)
					- Rajo Guna is dominant in this state, meaning, the sensual pleasures of the world dominate one's mind
				- **Moodha** (Stupefied)
					- Tamo Guna is dominant in this state, meaning, whatever lowers one's energy is what occupies their minds
					- **Krodha** (Anger), **Kaama** (Lust) and other vices (**Lobha**, **Moha** (Desire), **Mada** (Madness), **Matsarya** (Competition)) fill the mind
					- In this state, the Chittha is filled with:
						- **Vritthis**
						- **Nidra**
						- **Tandra**
						- **Aalasya**
						- **Pramaadha**
				- **Vikshipta** (Distracted)
					- Troubles of life attract one to Ishvara, and Sattva Guna takes presence
					- But Rajo Guna often distracts and tries to take over the mind
				- **Ekaagra** (Focused) / **Yoga Bhumi** (Yoga Stage)
					- Sattvika Vritthi is dominant
					- Rajo Guna and Tamo Guna are suppressed
				- **Niruddha** (Free)
			- **Vritthi** (Waves / Fluctuations)
				- Vritthis can be **Klishta** or Aklishta
				- Klishta Vritthis are bad because they generate Avidya Yukta, Vasana Roop and Samskaaras (Traditions), which keep the Purusha bound
				- **Kleshas**
					- **Avidya** (Lack of Knowledge)
					- **Asmita** (Not Smiling / Masked / Confusing Nature with Soul)
					- **Raaga** (Attachment)
					- **Dvesha** (Aversion)
					- **Abhinivesha** (Fear of Death)
				- Types of Vritthis
					- Preliminary Knowledge on this topic
						- **Pramaana** (Knowing Correctly)
							- **Pratyaksha** Pramaana Vritthi
							- **Anumaana** Pramaana Vritthi
							- **Aagama** / **Shabda** Pramaana Vritthi
					- Types
						- **Viparyaya** (Incorrect Knowledge)
						- **Vikalpa** (Fantasy or Imagination)
						- **Nidra** (Sleep)
						- **Smriti** (Recollection from Memory)
			- **Chitta Vritthi Nirodha** (Cessation of Fluctuations of the Mind)
				- Why
					- Vritthis cause **Sukha** (Pleasure), **Dukha** (Pain) and **Moha** (Desire)
						- Sukha leads to Raaga (Attachment)
						- Dukha leads to Dvesha (Aversion)
						- Moha leads to Avidya (Lack of Knowledge)
					- So Vritthis must be ceased
					- When Chittha comes into contact with Vishayaas (objects), our mind begins to think of their associated Sankaaras (Traditions)
					- These thoughts propel us into taking actions
					- When we can't manifest those actions in the external world, they result into Krodha (Anger), Kaama (Lust), Lobha, Moha (Desire), Mada (Madness), Matsarya (Competition), etc.
					- This Vishayaa Kaara Parinaama (Material Oriented Transformation) of Chittha is called Vritthi
				- How
					- Chitta 
				- Results
					- Destruction of **Kleshas** (Afflictions), **Karma** (Actions) and **Karmaashaya** (Effects of Actions)
					- Establishment of **Jeevaa Atma** in its true form or **Kaivalya**
			- Chitta returns to **Moola Prakriti** (Basic Nature) in two circumstances
				- By experiencing **Bhoga** (Indulgence) and **Apavarga** (Liberation), one returns to the normal state
				- During **Pralayavashtha** (Destroyed / Uncreated State), the Chittha returns to Moola Prakriti, but when the Atma takes a new life form, Chittha manifests again

		- **Texts**
			- Panchadasi by Madhava Acharya (A simple manual)
		- **Concepts**
			- Vritthis
				- They are the same concept as in Yoga
				- The types are:

						- Chittha is also considered to include Manas, Buddhi and Ahamkaara, in the context where it can be better called the mind-field.
	- 6.2. Bheda Abheda Vedaanta (Difference and Oneness)
		- By Bhaskaracharya
		- Individual self is both different and not different from Brahman
		- Compared to Nimbarkacharya, Bhaskaracharya believed the Oneness matters more, as that is Brahman's natural state
		- **Sub-denominations:**
			- 6.2.1. Dvaita Advaita / Svabhavika Bedha Abheda Vedaanta (Dual and Non-Dual / Difference and Oneness in the Natural State)
				- By Nimbarkacharya
				- Dualism and Monism, based on Vaishnava Bhedabheda Vedaanta Darshana
				- Both Oneness and Difference are equal, because that's Brahman's natural state
				- Nimbarka follows Parinama Vaada (The Proposition of Transformation), which states that the world is a real Parinama (transformation) of Brahman, to explain the cause of the world. Chit (Sentient) and Achit (Non-Sentient) forms of reality exist at a subtle form with Brahman in his natural state, in the varying Shaktis (Capacities). But he exerts his Capacities to bring them to the gross form.
	- 6.3. Vishishta Advaita Vedaanta (Qualified Non-Difference)
		- A Vaishnava school by Ramanujacharya, Ishvara is considered as Vishnu
		- The Tattva is knowledge of three things; Jiva (living beings) / sentient beings (Chit Brahman), Ajiva (non-living beings) / insentient beings (Achit Brahman) and Ishvara (Para Brahman)
		- Ishvara is Para Brahman with Kalyana Gunas (good attributes), and Jiva and Jagat are its secondary attributes
		- Chit is like Purusha in Sankya, and Achit is like Prakriti in Sankhya
		- Brahman is both the cause (Karana) and effect (Kaarya); the universe is not separate
		- The Universe has two causes; Nimitta Karana (Instrumental Cause) and Upadana Karana (Material Cause)
		- Bhakti is the sole means of liberation
		- Purpose of Life (Purushartha) is Artha (wealth), Kama (pleasure), Dharma (righteousness) and Moksha (liberation)
		- **General Description**
			- Cause and Effect
				- Vishishta Advaita Vedanta follows Sat-Kaarya Vaada (Proposition that Effects are Existent)
				- Vishishta Advaita explains Sat-Kaarya Vaada using Brahm Parinaama Vaada (Proposition of Transformation of Universe)
		- **Sub-denominations:**
			- 6.3.1. Akshar Purushottam Darshan (as termed by BAPS) / Swaminarayan Sampradaya
				- By Swami Narayana
				- A version of Vishishta Advaita Vedaanta, where Para Brahman is Krishna
				- Para Brahman is thought to have manifested as Swaminarayana
				- A distinction is made between Para Brahman, which is Purushottam Naraayan (Supreme Consciousness God), which is thought to reside in Swaminarayana who is part of Akshar Brahman, and Akshar Brahman, which is the cause of cosmic order
				- The original Swaminarayana Sampradaya believed that Akshar is the abode of Purushottam
				- BAPS believe that Akshar Brahman is always present in Earth as a guru, and an ideal devotee, in whom Purushottam Brahman resides
	- 6.4. Dvaita / Tattva Vaada Vedaanta (Dualistic / Proposition of Elements)
		- By Madhvaacharya
	- 6.5. Shuddha Advaita Vedaanta (Pure Oneness)
		- By Vallabhacharya
		- A Vaishnava tradition based on the worship of Krishna
		- Maya is not an illusion, but is a power of Ishvara. Ishvara is the creator and the created.
		- Bhakti is the path to realization, Jnana is also helpful; Karma precedes and follows realization
		- Moksha is not the goal, service of Krishna is
		- Everything is Krishna's Leela
	- 6.6. Achintya Bedha Abheda (Inconceivable Difference and Oneness)
		- By Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
	- 6.7. Modern Vedaanta
		- Personal Experience > Sruti

# Based on Deities
Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major Sampradayas. Of the historical division into six Darshanas (Philosophies), two schools, Vedaanta and Yoga, are currently the most prominent.

Classified by primary deity or deities, four major types of Hinduism include **Vishnu Worshippers**, **Shiva Worshippers**, **Adiparashakti Worshippers** and **Smartas** (five deities treated as same).

These deity-centered denominations feature a synthesis of various philosophies such as Sankhya, Yoga and Vedaanta, as well as shared spiritual concepts such as **Moksha**, **Dharma**, **Karma**, **Samsara**, ethical precepts such as **Ahimsa**, common texts (**Upanishads**, **Puranas**, **Mahabharata**, **Aagamas**), ritual grammar and rites of passage (**Vyakarana** and **Kalpa** Vedangas).

## Connection Between Darshanas and Denominations
- Shaivite
	- Shaiva Advaita / Shaiva Vishishta Advaita (Saguna Brahman = Shiva)

# Other Classic Sects
- Shrautism
	- Shrauta communities are very rare in India, the most well known being the ultra-orthodox Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala. They follow the "Purva-Meemaamsa" (earlier portion of Vedas) in contrast to Vedaanta followed by other Brahmins. They place importance on the performance of Vedic Sacrifice (Yajna). The Nambudiri Brahmins are famous for their preservation of the ancient Somayaagam, Agnichayana rituals which have vanished in other parts of India.
- Suryaism / Saurism

# Notes
Sampradaya in Indian origin religions, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, can be translated as 'tradition', 'spiritual lineage', 'sect', or 'religious system'.

To ensure continuity and transmission of Dharma, various Sampradayas have the Guru-Shishya Parampara in which Parampara or lineage of successive Gurus (masters) and Shishyas (disciples) serves as a spiritual channel and provides a reliable network of relationships that lends stability to a religious identity. 

Shramana is Vedic term for seeker or Shishya. Identification with and followership of Sampradayas is not static, as Sampradayas allow flexibility where one can leave one Sampradaya and enter another or practice religious syncretism by simultaneously following more than one Sampradaya. (This is in contrast to Shakhas)

Samparda is a Punjabi language term, used in Sikhism, for Sampradayas.

## Guru-Shishya Parampara
Sampradayas are living traditions of both teaching and practice within a specific religious-spiritual tradition. They are generally composed of a monastic order within a specific Guru lineage, with ideas developed and transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. A particular Guru lineage is called Parampara. By receiving Diksha (initiation) into the Parampara of a living Guru, one belongs to its proper Sampradaya.

To ensure continuity through Dharma transmission, various Sampardayas ensure continuity through Guru-Shishya Parampara where Guru teaches Shishyas in Gurukula, Matha, Akhara, and Viharas. Buddhism also has lineage of Gurus. Tibetan Buddhism has lineage of Lamas who teach in Gompas and Stupas.

### Continuity of sampradaya
See also: Guru Gotra and Gurunath

Sampradaya is a body of practice, views and attitudes, which are transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. Participation in Sampradaya forces continuity with the past, or tradition, but at the same time provides a platform for change from within the community of practitioners of this particular traditional group.
### Diksha: Initiation into Sampradaya
A particular Guru lineage in Guru-Shishya tradition is called Parampara, and may have its own Akharas and Gurukulas. By receiving Diksha (initiation) into the Parampara of a living Guru, one belongs to its proper Sampradaya.

One cannot become a member by birth, as is the case with Gotra, a seminal or hereditary dynasty.
### Authority on knowledge of truth

Membership in a Sampradaya not only lends a level of authority to one's claims on truth in Hindu traditional context, but also allows one to make those claims in the first place. An often quoted verse from the Padma Purana states:

> Mantras which are not received in Sampradaya are considered fruitless.

And another verse states:

> Unless one is initiated by a bona-fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession, the mantra he might have received is without any effect.

As Wright and Wright put it,

> If one cannot prove natal legitimacy, one may be cast out as a bastard. The same social standard applies to religious organizations. If a religious group cannot prove its descent from one of the recognized traditions, it risks being dismissed as illegitimate.

Nevertheless, there are also examples of teachers who were not initiated into a Sampradaya, Ramana Maharshi being a well-known example.

A Sanyasi belonging to the Sringeri Sharada Peetham once tried to persuade Ramana to be initiated into Sanyasa, but Ramana refused.
