**Vedaanga-s** are six auxiliary disciplines that are considered to be essential for the understanding and application of the Vedas.

The six Vedaanga-s are **Shikshaa** (phonetics), **Chandas** (prosody / poetic meter), **Vyaakarana** (grammar), **Niruktha** (etymology and linguistics), **Jyothisha** (astrology), and **Kalpa** (rituals and rites of passage).

**They are disciplines used to study the Veda-s (limbs of the Veda-s), not texts.**

Kalpa Vedanga studies gave rise to [[Dharma Soothra-s]] (alongside other Kalpa Soothra-s), which gave rise to [[Dharma Shaasthra]]-s.
