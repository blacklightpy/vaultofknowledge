# Aagamas

- Aagamas are traditions.
	- They are voluminous and are divided into Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava.
	- They are also called Tantras, but that's mostly Shakta Aagamas.
	- The Aagama texts include:
		- 28 Shaiva Aagamas
		- 64 Shakta Aagamas (also called Tantras)
		- 108 Vaishnava Aagamas (also called Pancharaatra Samhitas)
		- and numerous Upa Aagamas.
# Dvaita Vedanta vs Advaita Vedanta
- Dvaita Vedanta is dualistic
- Advaita Vedanta is monistic
# Advaita Vedanta
It is based on the teachings of Adi Shankara, who is the first Shankaracharya.

His followers are Shankaracharyas. (Acharya means teacher, so Shankaracharya means teacher in the ways of Shankara)

He set up four monasteries (called Mathas or Pithams) where realized men would teach.
