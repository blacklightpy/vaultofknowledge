- Tantras
	- Tantra (/ˈtæntrə/; Sanskrit: तन्त्र, lit. 'expansion-device, salvation-spreader; loom, weave, warp') is an esoteric **yogic** tradition that developed on the Indian subcontinent from the middle of the 1st millennium CE onwards in both Hinduism and Buddhism.
	- The term tantra, in the Indian traditions, also means any systematic broadly applicable "text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique or practice". A key feature of these traditions is the use of mantras, and thus they are commonly referred to as **Mantramārga** ("Path of Mantra") in Hinduism or **Mantrayāna** ("Mantra Vehicle") and **Guhyamantra** ("Secret Mantra") in Buddhism.

The Tantric texts can be divided into three classes:
(1) Shaiva Agamas (traditions of the followers of Shiva)
(2) Vaishnava Samhitas (“Collections of the Vaishnavas,” a name borrowed from the Vedic Samhitas)
(3) Shakta Tantras (“Looms of the followers of the Goddess Shakti”). 
However, they all have the common bond of venerating the Goddess

Hindu scriptures, also known as Shastras, are a vast and diverse collection of texts sacred to Hindus. They are generally divided into two categories: Shruti (heard) and Smriti (remembered).
# Shruti
Shruti scriptures are considered revealed and include the four Vedas: 

**Rigveda**, **Yajurveda**, **Samaveda**, and **Atharvaveda**. 

Each Veda has four parts: **Samhitas** (mantras and hymns), **Brahmanas** (rituals and sacrifices), **Aranyakas** (contemplations for forest dwellers), and **Upanishads** (philosophical and spiritual teachings).
# Smriti
Smriti scriptures are based on human memory and include epic texts like the **Mahabharata** (which contains the **Bhagavad Gita**) and **Ramayana**, as well as law codes (**Dharma Shastras**), **Puranas** (mythological and historical accounts), and **Tantras** (esoteric rituals and meditation techniques).

These scriptures cover a wide range of topics, including rituals, morals, law, mythology, cosmology, and spirituality. They reflect the diverse nature of Hinduism and offer rich insights into the religion's history, philosophy, and culture.

# Sutras
**Sutras** are a type of ancient Indian text that are written in a concise and aphoristic styleword "sutra" comes from the Sanskrit word "sutra," which means "**thread**." Sutras are similar to *aphorisms* or *maxims*, and are meant to be brief and easy to remember.

Sutras were traditionally used as a **mnemonic device to help students remember** and understand complex concepts. In ancient India, sutras were often used as a teaching tool, and were memorized and recited by students as a way of learning and preserving the teachings of their guru (teacher).

Sutras are typically written in a highly condensed and elliptical style, and often use technical terminology and abbreviations. This makes them difficult for the uninitiated to understand, and requires a deep knowledge of the subject matter and the language in which they are written.
## Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

The **Yoga Sutras of Patanjali** are a collection of 196 Sanskrit Sutras (aphorisms) on the practice of yoga, written by the Indian **sage Patanjali** around 400 CE. Yoga Sutras are considered to be one of the most important texts on the philosophy and practice of yoga, and are considered to be a foundational text of the Yoga Darshana, or Yoga Philosophy.

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are divided into four chapters, or **Padas**, which cover the following topics:
1. Samadhi Pada: This chapter discusses the nature of the mind, the causes of suffering, and the means of achieving liberation through the practice of yoga.
2. Sadhana Pada: This chapter discusses the practical aspects of Yoga, including the eight limbs of Yoga, which are: Yama (ethical restraints), Niyama (observances), Asana (physical postures), Pranayama (breath control), Pratyahara (sense withdrawal), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), and Samadhi (absorption).
3. Vibhuti Pada: This chapter discusses the supernatural powers that can be attained through the practice of Yoga, and the dangers of becoming attached to these powers.
4. Kaivalya Pada: This chapter discusses the ultimate goal of Yoga, which is the attainment of Kaivalya, or liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
