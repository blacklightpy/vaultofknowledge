These are the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge. They are also called Nigama.

The sections of the Vedas can be divided into two, or three broad divisions.
1. Karma Khanda (Ritual Portion)
	- Includes Samhithas and Brahmanas
2. Upaasana Khanda (Worship Portion) [Minor Classification]
	- [[Upaasana]] (mostly in Aranyakas)
3. Jnaana Khanda (Wisdom Portion)
	- Includes Aranyakas and [[Upanishads]]

Vedas are passed on through [[Vedic Shakhas|Shakhas]].

Shakhas focused on pronunciation, and not on the meaning of the words. So people ended up not knowing what Samhithas meant after the Vedic period, considering them as sacred sounds.

# Validity
- Veda originates from the root Vid, meaning "to know", and is cognate with Vidya (Knowledge)
- According to the Upanishads, there are two type of Vidya:
	- Para Vidya (Deep Knowledge)
	- Apara Vidya (Emprical Knowledge)
- Para Vidya is the goal, and Apara Vidya outlines the path
- Para Vidya is the knowledge of the Atma and Brahma
## Veda is endless
> The Ṛcs are limited (parimita),
> The Samans are limited,
> And the Yajuses are limited,
> But of the Word Brahman, there is no end.
> 
> — Taittiriya Samhita VII.3.1.4, Translated by Barbara Holdrege

- Samaveda
	- Talavakara Aranyaka or Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana belongs to the Talavakara or Jaiminiya Shakha of the Samaveda. A part of this text forms the Kena Upanishad.
	- Aranyaka Samhita is not a typical Aranyaka text: rather the Purvarchika of the Samaveda Samhitas has a section of mantras, called the 'Aranyaka Samhita', on which the Aranyagana Samans are sung.

The Atharvaveda has no surviving Aranyaka, though the Gopatha Brahmana is regarded as its Aranyaka, a remnant of a larger, lost Atharva (Paippalada) Brahmana.
## Upanishads
The Upanishads are late Vedic and post-Vedic Sanskrit texts that "document the transition from the archaic ritualism of the Veda into new religious ideas and institutions" and the emergence of the central religious concepts of Hinduism.

They are the most recent addition to the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, and deal with meditation, philosophy, consciousness, and ontological knowledge.

Earlier parts of the Vedas dealt with mantras, benedictions, rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices.

There are 108 Upanishads, and each Upanishad is associated with a separate [[Vedic Shakhas|Vedic Shakha]].
### Mahavakyas
They mean "Great Sayings", and these four are handpicked from Upanishads of the four Vedas. There are other Mahavakyas, but these are "the Mahavakyas".
