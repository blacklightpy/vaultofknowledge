	- Roman Era
		- Pharisees (a philosophical group, followed the Oral Torah. Mostly the common people and Rabbis. Jesus would've been a Pharisee.)
		- Essenes (they believed the others corrupted the city and the Temple, and kinda followed the Oral Torah. They were Isolationists)
		- Sadducees (They wanted to be the priestly caste, and rejected the Oral Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim (and hence notions of afterlife and the Temple rites). They were the wealthy people.)

			- Their Ten Commandments tell them to build an altar at Mount Gerizim.
			- Same goes in Deuteronomy, where Jews were asked to build an altar at Mount Ebal, while Samaritans were to build it at Mount Gerizim.
			- 1946 Dead Sea Scrolls (Second Temple Era writings) that read Gerizim which suggests that the Samaritans had the correct reading.
			- The Temple at Mount Gerizim was destroyed by John Hyrcanus in 108 BCE, to set Jerusalem as the only place of worship.
			- John 4:21–24 (Jesus said neither temple will matter)
		- They follow a different Samaritan Pentateuch, as opposed to the Masoretic Text

		- About 900 of them remain
