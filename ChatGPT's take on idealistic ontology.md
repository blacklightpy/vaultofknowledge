I asked ChatGPT to make its own view of how the non-dual comes into being.

It made the analogy of a spherical mirror that emits and reflects light perfectly! But that was my own analogy!!

I made the same analogy two weeks ago and then started going on to see if that means it's like a black body, but then got lost on that track. I documented it in my other vault as follows (and ofcourse, I forgot to write the same description out, that's why I said I got lost on that train of thought):

> **To seek knowledge through empirical reality alone would be like surrounding myself with mirrors to find myself. I'd only get trapped by mirrors.** Or if I'm blind, I'd hit my body harder and it's only cause me pain. I have to look within.

> You know this, because you (the conscious reflection) have not seen yourself doing anything other than through a mirror or video. 

> Now when you look in the mirror, you realize that you are breathing, but you are not doing it voluntarily. So breathing is outside of who you are, and the same goes for other biological systems.

In another sense, since Brahman completely has the reflective and projective properties, the spherical mirror is only an analogy for something that's not necessarily closed, but does reflect at all the points that also emit.
