Just look at:

> The first psychiatrists beginning with Freud in the west considered homosexuality to be a form of mental illness. Various forms of treatment were prescribed – mainly aversion therapy in which pictures of young men were shown to the “patient” while at the same time administering mild electric shocks. The effect that this ‘treatment’ had rather than convert the ‘patient’ to heterosexuality was to turn them off sex altogether. About 30 years ago homosexuality was removed from the list of pyschiatric diseases. In the 20th century those who are of a homosexual orientation have become a political entity demanding equal civil rights and freedom from oppression and discrimination along with women, blacks, Jews and all other oppressed minorities in the west.

He tried electric shocks to convert homosexuals to heterosexuals? How foolish are people? This is laughable, that such people are even considered geniuses.

This is why I hold that history is a nonsensical creation put in place by God.
