# The Problem
As I was studying Hinduism as part of creating this note: [[Trying to Consolidate Hinduism 1]], I saw in a website ([link here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120002556/http://sanatanadhara.com/antakarana/)) that the verse ==maha:jano ena gathas sapandha== appeared in the Mahabharatha, as a reply Arjuna gave to a Yaksha. But I was not able to find any source for it while looking at the texts, outside of some mentions made by ISKCON/Hare Krishna founder Prabhupada. So I decided to track down the references.
# According to LLM ChatGPT

ChatGPT said that the reference is in the Yaksha Prashna.

Sources for Yaksha Prashna are in (I've verified it):

- Chapters 297-298, Parva 44: Araneya Parva, Parva 3: Vana Parva (Aranyaka Parva) in Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) Critical Edition of Mahabharatha
- Sections 309-312, Yaksha Prashna, in KM Ganguli's English Translation of Mahabharatha

But ChatGPT gave no answer to my query on pin-pointing the verse.

I googled for it, and the only sources I could find were from Prabhupada's lectures on Srimad Bhagavata, the full transcript of which showed me more problems with his personality, some of which I'd already known earlier, with him calling Kapila a fake and an impostor, and saying Lord Kapila founded the true an theistic Saankhya as is written in the Bhagavad Geetha.

> 
> In the Mahābhārata (Vana-parva 313.117) it is stated:
> 
> > tarko ‘pratiṣṭhaḥśrutayo vibhinnā nāsāv ṛṣir yasya mataṃ na bhinnam dharmasya tattvaṃ nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ
> 
> Translation:
> 
> > “Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated, self-realized person. Consequently, as the śāstras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahājanas advocate.”

# From Prabhupada's Lectures

> So _śrutayo vibhinnā nāsāv munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam._ And if we consult great thinkers or philosophers, they have got their different opinion also. Some philosopher says, "I think this is right," "I think this is right." So whom you will accept? They are also of difference opinion. _Tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā nāsāv munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam_ [_Cc. Madhya_ 25.57, _Mahābhārata, Vana-parva_ 313.117].

> Therefore to understand the Absolute Truth, it is very difficult to find out how to have it. But the only one way recommended in the Vedic scripture, that _mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ_ [_Cc. Madhya_ 17.186].
