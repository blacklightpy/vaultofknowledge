Either you are deliberately trying to **sabotage** my religion, or you don't know, which I'm afraid, is worse.

(1) Static Monism and Dynamic Monism
(2) No. The Veda-s do not care about managing Vyavahaarika Sathya, except to ensure that people can be led to Brahma Jnaana. That is what the Shaasthra-s do.

Which infidel said that? Let me know, so that I may slay him.
Ardha-Naari-Eeshvar

No, that's not in our religion.
No, that's not how it works.

Remember how I once told you that Malayalam would soon be replaced by English, considering the way of progress? At the time, I didn't see the relevance of the languages. But now, even if no one else does it, I will single handedly preserve and make relevant all Dravidian and Devanagari scripts and languages.

What the above verse says is that Brahman (Ultimate Reality) is True, World is apparent (Mithya, i.e. not unreal), Jeeva (Living Beings) and Brahman are not unlike. By living beings, we are referring to their Aatman, or Jeeva-Aatman, not their bodies or their minds - which are all considered to be part of the material world.

Now, schools of Hindu-ism describe the differences between Aatman, Param-Aatman and Brahman. Aatman is Jeeva, Param-Aatman is Eeshvara, and Brahman

Advaitha Vedaantha describes that Aatman is Brahman. But this is only qualitatively true, not quantitatively. But Advaitha Vedaantha holds that Maaya is only an illusion that disappears upon Brahma Jnaana, while other schools hold that Maaya is sustained by Param-Aatman.

So to those schools, Brahman is Eeshvara, and is Saguna, since Eeshvara is Saguna. 

Krishna is Param Aatman (BG).

Katha (two birds)

The knowledge acquired in the material world is, just like modern science, limited in its scope, and cannot make any claims about what is beyond the material world. Because of this, the Veda-s are the only sources for Brahma Jnaana (as per the Veda-s). But Thanthra-s do the same thing, so the more general term is Shruthi (what is heard, through meditation).

A common analogy that describes this is the Ghata-Aakasha (pot-space) analogy. However, I'll use a shorter analogy. Consider a monitor of an infinite resolution and DPI to be projecting an image on to its screen. There, each entity in the image is covering a part of the monitor. Now, the part of the monitor that covers a living being is called the Jeeva-Aatma, while the entire monitor, i.e. what underlies the whole image, is called the Param Aatma, or Eeshvara (God).

- In terms of levels of existence, there are 3 Shareera-s (bodies): Sthoola Shareera (gross body), Sookshma Shareera (subtle body), Kaarana Shareera (causal body)
- In terms of states of consciousness, there are 3 + 1 Avastha-s (states): Jaagratha (waking), Nidra (dreaming), Sushupthi (deep sleep) - as well as Turiya (the trascendental, or ultimate state)
- In terms of coverings, there are 5 Kosha-s (sheaths): Aananda-Maya Kosha (blissful sheath), Vijnaana-Maya Kosha (intelligent sheath), Mano-Maya Kosha (mental sheath), Praaana-Maya Sheath (life-rich sheath) and Anna-Maya Kosha (food-rich sheath, i.e. material body)
