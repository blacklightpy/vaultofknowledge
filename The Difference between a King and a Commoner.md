The difference between a king and a commoner is

Either you are deliberately trying to **sabotage** my religion, or you don't know, which I'm afraid, is worse.

(1) Static Monism and Dynamic Monism
(2) No. The Veda-s do not care about managing Vyavahaarika Sathya, except to ensure that people can be led to Brahma Jnaana. That is what the Shaasthra-s do.

Which infidel said that? Let me know, so that I may slay him.

No, that's not in our religion.
No, that's not how it works.

To Malayalam: After ടവർഗ്ഗം, there was a ഺവർഗ്ഗം with ഺ and ഩ. ഺ and ഩ got replaced by റ and ന. ഺ was never used in singular, but was used as ഺ്ഺ and ഩ്ഺ, which got replaced by റ്റ and ന്റ. // Thamiyzh / yzha / yjzha / Vayjzha

ഋ (ൃ), ൠ (ൄ), ഌ (ൢ), ൡ (ൣ), ല (ல), യ ( ്യ), ര ( ്ര), വ ( ്വ), അം (ം), അഃ (ഃ) 
ഩ
ൔ / ം, ൕ / യ്, ൖ / ഴ്

Remember how I once told you that Malayalam would soon be replaced by English, considering the way of progress? At the time, I didn't see the relevance of the languages. But now, even if no one else does it, I will single handedly preserve and make relevant all Dravidian and Devanagari scripts and languages.

Caste is Jaathi, not Varna. Jaathi is part of the Samskrithi (culture), while Varna is one's inclination as per the constitution of their Guna-s. Now, there are people who argue that the Guna-s in one's body is inherited through their parents' genes. However this theory falls flat on its head when using either (1) verses from the Shruthi, or (2) empirical data, which is usually part of common sense.

Firstly, the theory argues that a person (Sookshma Shareera) with 'so and so' Vaasana-s (mental impressions by accumulated Guna-s) will only take birth (i.e. acquire a Sthoola Shareera) in the household of a family who has the same Vaasana-s. But then, that would refute how a carpenter's son would be inclined to be a musician.

Secondly, it defies how (1) the Shruthi-s such as Bhagavad Geetha quotes how Varna-s are based on one's Guna-s and secondly, that the proportion of Guna-s in the mind arise through one's Karma-s and that in the body arises through the food they consume.

The fourth Prapaathaka of Chaandogya Upanishad (4.4.3 - 4.4.5) deal with the case of Sathyakaama Jaabaala, who wanted to learn the Veda-s, whose mother Jaabaala was a prostitute, and his father was unknown. When he told this to sage Gauthama, he understood that he was a Braahmana simply because he was truthful, and proceeded to initiate him.

Now, I was arguing this example with a proponent of birth-based Varna-s, who based his claims on the Manu Smrithi (the common one, and not Aarya Samaaj's Vishuddha Manu Smrithi) who unsurprisingly was extremely bigoted as well. I told him how the son of a Shoodra was initiated as a Braahmana. He replied that Gauthama recognizing him to be a Braahmana meant that his father was a Braahmana. But then I pointed out to him the analogy of the carpenter's son wanting to be something else, as well as how the Manu Smrithi shows that the son of a Braahmana man and a Shoodra woman would be a Nishaada.

When I pointed out to him that as per the Manu Smrithi, the 

Braahmana whore (I think he should be given an award for cooking up such bullshit)

There are other instances, where Karna was able to withstand the pain of being bitten by a scorpion, and seeing this Parashurama was able to infer that he was a Kshathriya. 

It is not implied in the Purusha Sootha either.
Neither do you know what Purusha is, neither do you know what God is. By the term God, what is implied?

In Hindu-ism, we do not have a 'good and bad' dichotomy, we have a tri-stimulus of the three Guna-s: Satthva (Brightness), Thamas (Inertia / Darkness) and Rajas (Excitement / Action) - that is, in nature (Prakrithi). However, the ultimate reality is beyond this material nature of three Guna-s, and is called Brahman (not Braahmana - so that you won't insinuate).

Now, why are

**To Mozbir Ullah:**

What the above verse says is that Brahman (Ultimate Reality) is True, World is apparent (Mithya, i.e. not unreal), Jeeva (Living Beings) and Brahman are not unlike. By living beings, we are referring to their Aatman, or Jeeva-Aatman, not their bodies or their minds - which are all considered to be part of the material world.

Now, schools of Hindu-ism describe the differences between Aatman, Param-Aatman and Brahman. Aatman is Jeeva, Param-Aatman is Eeshvara, and Brahman

Advaitha Vedaantha describes that Aatman is Brahman. But this is only qualitatively true, not quantitatively. But Advaitha Vedaantha holds that Maaya is only an illusion that disappears upon Brahma Jnaana, while other schools hold that Maaya is sustained by Param-Aatman.

So to those schools, Brahman is Eeshvara, and is Saguna, since Eeshvara is Saguna. 

Krishna is Param Aatman (BG).

Chariot Analogy.

The knowledge acquired in the material world is, just like modern science, limited in its scope, and cannot make any claims about what is beyond the material world. Because of this, the Veda-s are the only sources for Brahma Jnaana (as per the Veda-s). But Thanthra-s do the same thing, so the more general term is Shruthi (what is heard, through meditation).

A common analogy that describes this is the Ghata-Aakasha (pot-space) analogy. However, I'll use a shorter analogy. Consider a monitor of an infinite resolution and DPI to be projecting an image on to its screen. There, each entity in the image is covering a part of the monitor. Now, the part of the monitor that covers a living being is called the Jeeva-Aatma, while the entire monitor, i.e. what underlies the whole image, is called the Param Aatma, or Eeshvara (God).

- In terms of levels of existence, there are 3 Shareera-s (bodies): Sthoola Shareera (gross body), Sookshma Shareera (subtle body), Kaarana Shareera (causal body)
- In terms of states of consciousness, there are 3 + 1 Avastha-s (states): Jaagratha (waking), Nidra (dreaming), Sushupthi (deep sleep) - as well as Turiya (the trascendental, or ultimate state)
- In terms of coverings, there are 5 Kosha-s (sheaths): Aananda-Maya Kosha (blissful sheath), Vijnaana-Maya Kosha (intelligent sheath), Mano-Maya Kosha (mental sheath), Praaana-Maya Sheath (life-rich sheath) and Anna-Maya Kosha (food-rich sheath, i.e. material body)

Soothra: Give the analogy of one who wants to climb an obstacle course.

(Regarding the apparent contradiction between the analogies, and the notion that Brahman is unchanging. Consider the analogy of a person who wants to complete an obstacle course. He will have a plan. But when he executes it, there will be differences. This is because we are imperfect beings. But when it comes to God, he says "let it be done" and so it will be done. In that sense, our imperfections too are part of the perfect will of God.)

(But Advaita Vedaanta is different. In it, Brahman is too complete to even have a will. The world of duality is therefore only due to Maaya or Aavidya, and one's existence is due the resemblance of Brahman on the Kaarana Shareera, or causal body, an aspect of Maaya. A Jeeva is the resemblance of Brahman on the Kaarana Shareera when Prakrithi is unmanifest (i.e. during deep sleep), while it is the resemblance of Brahman on the Antah Karana or Sookshma Shareera when Prakrithi is manifest (when awake or dreaming)).

(It can be assumed that Vikshepa Shakthi and Avarna Shakthi of Maaya are like crests and troughs imposed on Brahman, while Brahman is the unaltered plane surface that provides relative existence to the crests and troughs).
