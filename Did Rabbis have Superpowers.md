As I was reading the account of Rabbi Eliezer in the Oven of Akhnai as I related in [[Bat Kol]], I saw how he moved a tree and made a stream flow backward and could destroy places by looking at them.

There's a Jewish joke:

> Three hasidim are bragging about their Rebbes: "My rebbe is very powerful. He was walking once, and there was a big lake in his path. He waved his handkerchief, and there was lake on the right, lake on the left, but no lake in the middle."
> 
> To which the second retorted, "That's nothing. My rebbe is even more powerful. He was walking once, and there was a huge mountain in his path. He waved his handkerchief, and there was mountain on the right, mountain on the left, but no mountain in the middle!"
> 
> Said the third, "Ha! That is still nothing! My rebbe is the most powerful. He was walking once on Shabbos (on which it is forbidden to handle money), and there was a wallet crammed full of cash in his path. He waved his handkerchief, and it was Shabbos on the right, Shabbos on the left, but not Shabbos in the middle!"
