Enumeration requires the values be known beforehand.
But labels can be applied without looking up the map (of other values).
The con of labels being that they can be duplicated.

Enumeration, unless automated, can be bad for modifications.
Enumeration, if automated or even if modified, may break the purpose of enumeration, depending on how it is implemented, and how updates are handled (i.e. we may expect the value to remain the same forever, but when values are updated, we may not )

So the update policy itself has to be fixed in the beginning, and people should be handled with the latest version of the policy they were made aware of, since update news may not reach everyone (especially in political contexts). However, even that policy of handling needs to be set beforehand.

This is part of why theofascists claim that there has to be a revelation sent by God. But reality is that everything is dynamic.

If God is a mountain. all descriptions of God (texts) are like snapshots taken from different angles. While God is one, 

To say that God would send a text is like saying God would ask all people to stand at one location. Of course, that's the principle by which organized religion is built. However, God is not a mountain, but the basis of all reality, and therefore God is in all things and ideas as their basis. So there is no necessity or rationale for everyone to consecrate at one place to worship God, because God is infinite, and is without a centre, and so is the universe. The Earth has a centre, but it is not at the core that we worship God, and the surface of Earth is again, without a centre.

God's nature is too vast for us to comprehend, so a symbol won't suffice. However a symbol is necessary for us to refer to God.
