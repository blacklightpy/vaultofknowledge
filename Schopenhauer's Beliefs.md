He took Kant's transcendental idealism as the foundation of his philosophy. He described transcendental idealism as the distinction between "phenomenon" ()

In his work, The World as Will and Representation, he identifies the inner essence of everything as a "will" - blind and unconscious, outside space and time, and free from multiplicity. And he said that the world of objects in space and time, and related by causality, only exists as a representation dependent on the thinking subject, and not as a world in of itself. In other words, the "world" is an objectification of the will.

He said that a reader would be best prepared to understand The World of Will and Representation if they were familiar with "the divine Plato", and even more so if they were familiar with the philosophy of the Upanishad-s of the Indian Veda-s. He considered Platonic "forms" to be existing on an intermediate ontological level between the will and the representation.
