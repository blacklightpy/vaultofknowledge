- **1940s-50s**: Batch Processing
	- Introduction of punch card-based programming; sequential job processing.
- **1950s-60s**: Multiprogramming
	- Simultaneous programs in memory; efficient CPU utilization during I/O.
- **1960s-70s**: Time-Sharing
	- CPU time shared among programs at intervals; interactive computing.
- **1970s-80s**: Introduction of GUI
	- Adoption of GUIs with icons, menus, and user-friendly interfaces.
- **1980s-90s**: Networked Systems
	- Specialized OSs for computer networks; file sharing and remote access.
- **Late 1990s - Early 2000s**: Mobile OS
