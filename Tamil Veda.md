The term is used to refer to three books:

- [[Thiru Kural]] - a secular book of 1330 sayings, by Valluvar
- Thevaram - a Saiva book of nearly 800 devotional songs by Nayanars
- Divya Prabandham - a Vaisnava book of 4000 devotional songs, by Alvars. It is prioritized over Sanskrit Vedic hymns in Tamil Nadu.

Visistadvaita Vedanta is considered Ubhaya Vedanta because it includes both the Tamil Vedas and Sanskrit Vedas.
