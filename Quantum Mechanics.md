# My ideas (listed first so that I can explore them later)
My usual interpretation was based on the ["classical wave optics formulation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#Classical_wave-optics_formulation). But it looks like I need to consider the individual particle double slit experiment more. Well, my idea is still then to consider the complex part of the wavefunction instead of neglecting its value.

> [!NOTE] Individual particle effect observed with light
> But the third paragraph on the Wikipedia page about double slit experiment shows that the individual particle effect was also observable with laser beams of photons. Now that's something I'll need to explore too.

> >In the basic version of this experiment, a [coherent light source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)"), such as a [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate([[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-Lederman-7)][[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-Feynman-8)]). The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to [interfere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation) "Interference (wave propagation)"), producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles ([[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-Lederman-7)][[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-9)]). However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles (not waves); the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen ([[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-10)]). Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave) ([[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-11)][[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-12)][[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-Müller-Kirsten-13)][[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-Plotnitsky-14)][[15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-Rae-15)]). However, [such experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#Which_way) demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. These results demonstrate the principle of [wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality") ([[16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-16)][[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#cite_note-17)]).

Another interesting thing is how if we scale the solar system (I know it's just an arbitrary, and a mostly planar system, still) to the size of an atom, to assume it being the atom of a world, and see ourselves as being made of these solar system atoms, then if we consider our normal motion in terms of a new unit, say new-meters/sec instead of meters/sec, if we compare the speed of normal motion to the speed of these betres per second, the ratio would be similar to the ratio of our normal speed to the Planck speed. Well the same could apply to the planets too, as having the equivalent sizes of atoms or the Planck length. I don't remember how much exactly, but it was kind of close to subatomic levels with a few magnitudes of order off here and there.

The point is not about the importance of the solar system model, it's about, if the motion of a system is faster than the Planck time/Planck second, which is simply the speed of light, if we think of Planck frequency as the FPS or refresh rate of the universe, won't we only be able to see the positions of the particle when it is at certain points rather than as it having a traceable path? And if that's the case, wouldn't we only interpret it as random, because we can't udn
# Shortcomings
- "God does not play dice" - Einstein
- Is the electron a probability wave ($\psi^*\psi$), or is it the orbital itself ($\psi$)?
- It could be that the wave is vibrating in 4D space, like a string is vibrating in 2D space.
	- These theories are grouped under the "Hidden Variable Theory"
		- e.g. Pilot Wave Theory (or de Broglie-Bohm Theory)
			- Has hydrodynamic analogues
		- The problem with most hidden variable theories is that when you try to write a Lagrangian for such a system, you aren't able to incorporate the Lorentz Invariant to start with.

# Various Interpretations of the Model
- Ensemble interpretation
- Copenhagen Interpretation
	- Doesn't tell you what $\psi$ means, but just tells you that $\psi\psi^*$ gives the probability of finding a particle at a point (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcNiA06WNvI)
- Pilot Wave Theory
	- The silicon droplet hydrodynamic analogue
- Quantum Logic
- Time Symmetric Theory
- Many Words Interpretation
- Consciousness Causes Collapse
- Many Minds Interpretation
- Consistent Histories
- Transactional Interpretation
- Objective Collapse Theories
- Relational Interpretation
- QBism
