It is said that Brahmins were granted Swarga on Earth by Parashurama.

I read about this when I saw that Nangeli cutting off her breasts was a refusal of this Brahminical Swarga, on the basis of which lower castes were supposed to pay taxes.

These land grants given to by kings were recorded in Copper Plates (NCERT Class 7, Chapter 2: Kings and Kingdoms).
