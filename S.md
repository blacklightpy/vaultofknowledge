Yudhisthira said |
O lord of the grandfathers tell me the names of Lord Śiva
He became very fortunate in fact for the illusion of the universe || 1 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Bhishma said |
O Lord Vishnu, master of the gods and demons, you should tell me
O Shiva, Visvaroopa, what Yudhisthira asks me || 2 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

A thousand names of the god by Tandi, the womb of Brahma
It is reported to Brahma in the world of Brahma what happened in the past || 3 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Dvaipayanas and others were also rich in asceticism
Let the sages, who are well-vowed and self-controlled, hear what you are saying 4 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

O Dhruva, O Nandi, O Hotra, O protector, O creator of the universe, O fire!
O lord tell me the great fortune of Mundi and Kapardina || 5 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Vasudeva said |
It is not possible to know the course of actions of the Lord in truth 6 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The gods headed by Hiranyagarbha and the great sages with Indra
They do not know the death or the beginning of the subtle-seeing
How can that be known by a mere man, the path of the virtuous? 7 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I have described some of the virtues of that demon-killer
I will tell you exactly what I have done for the lord of the vows || 8 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Vaishampayana said |
Having thus spoken the Supreme Personality of Godhead described the virtues of that great soul
He took a bath and became clean and told the wise man || 9 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Vasudeva said |
Serve me, O lords of the Brahmins, and you, my dear Yudhisthira
You, Chapageya, listen to the names of the Lord of the universe 10 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And what I have achieved in the past is very difficult for the sake of Samba
And as I have seen the Lord in the past in meditation || 11 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Shambara was killed earlier by the wise Raukmineya |
Twelve years ago, Jambavati told me 12 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Rukmini looked at Pradyumna, Charudeshna and other sons
She came to me seeking a son and spoke these words, O Yudhisthira 13 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Brave, the best of the strong, the beloved, the spotless
Give me a son equal to yourself, O infallible one, soon 14 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

There is nothing in the three worlds that is unattainable to you here
O leader of the dynasty, you created the worlds that others did not desire 15 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

You have been dry for twelve years by the wind
Worshiping the husband of the animals Rukmini gave birth to sons || 16 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Charudeshna and Sucharu are beautifully dressed and have a reputation
They are beautifully heard and of beautiful fame, Pradyumna and Shambhu 17 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

as they were born to Rukmini's sons of beautiful prowess
and give me a son who is strong 18 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Encouraged thus by the goddess I spoke to her of beautiful waist
Allow me, O queen, to do as you say
She told me to go for victory and for Shiva || 19 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Brahma, Shiva and Kasyapa are the rivers and the gods who follow the mind
The fields, the herbs, the sacrificial vehicles, the chants, the sages, the earth 20 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The sea, the south, the stoves, the bears, the ancestors and the planets
The wives of the gods, the daughters of the gods, and the mothers of the gods 21 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The manvas, the cows, the moon, the sun and Hari
Savitri and Brahma Vidya are the seasons, the years and the nights 22 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Moments, lavas, moments, minutes, and the passage of ages
May they protect you everywhere you go, O Yadava, bringing you happiness
Go the path of evil, O sinless one, without being careless 23 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Having thus blessed her I gave her permission to go to the daughter of the lord of the monkeys
in the presence of his father, the best of men, and his mother, the king, and so on 24 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The daughter of the king of the Vidyadharas was very distressed and informed me of the meaning of what she had said to me
Then, in great distress, he gave them leave to the club and the very strong Rama 25 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Having obtained permission from the teachers I thought of Tarkshya
He carried me to the snow and I let him go 26 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

There I saw wonderful feelings on the top of the mountain
I see the field and the best of austerities and the best of hermitages 27 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The divine Vaiyaghrapada of the great Upamanyu |
Worshiped by the gods and gandharvas, it is endowed with Brahma and Lakshmi 28 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

white, pumpkin, kadamba, coconut, kurabaka, ketaka, jambu and patala
Vatavarunakavatsanabhabilvai saralakapitthapriyalasalatala || 29 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Badarikundapunnagairashokamratimuktakaih |
Bhallataka, Madhuka, Champak and Pansa || 30 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

It is covered with many kinds of wild trees bearing fruits and flowers
It is covered with flowers, shrubs and creepers and adorned with banana trees 31 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

It is decorated with fruits and trees that are edible by various birds
It is adorned with clusters of forests placed in their proper places || 32 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

crowded with elephants, tigers, lions and islands
It was crowded with turtles and peacocks and covered with cats and snakes
It is served by beans and deer, buffalo and bears 33 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

It is mixed with the dust of various flowers and is inhabited by elephants
The wind blew here pleasantly, full of the songs of divine women 34 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The sound of the streams and the auspicious chirping of the birds and the enlarged elephants
O hero with the songs and the generous and auspicious sounds of the kinnaras and the chants of the Samas || 35 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

It is unthinkable even to the mind and adorned with other lakes
It was decorated with large fireplaces and covered with kusha grass 36 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

O King it is adorned with holy and pure water and is always attended by the daughter of Jahnu
It was adorned with fire-like figures by the great sages who were the greatest of the upholders of righteousness 37 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Vayuharairambupairjapyanityai samprakshalai yatibhir dhyananityai |
It was adorned with smoke-eaters, hot drinks and milk-pots, and was surrounded by the great Brahmins 38 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

cowboys, stonecutters, and tooth mortars
They are pepper-eaters and foam-eaters and also deer-eaters 39 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

They carried those very painful rules and were very austere
Seeing him, his eyes widened, he began to enter 40 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

It is well worshiped by hosts of gods and great souls like Shiva, O Bharatha, who perform pious deeds
The circle of that hermitage always shone like the sky, O king, like the circle of the sun 41 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

They play with snakes, nakula, deer and tigers|
I asked him about his health in religion and in the class of disciples 47 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then the Lord spoke to me with the most beautiful Samna
You will undoubtedly have a son equal to yourself, O Krishna 48 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He performed great austerities and pleased the Lord
Here the god is playing with his wife, O transcendental one 49 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Here is the best of the gods, the gods and sages in the past
By austerities, celibacy, truth and self-control
Having satisfied them, they attained their auspicious desires, O Janardana 50 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He is the treasure of effulgence and austerities in this world
Even in a concise manner, releasing emotions containing good and evil
He is with the goddess whom you pray to, O destroyer of enemies 51 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The demon Merukampana became the son of Hiranyakasipu
He obtained all the wealth of the gods from Sharva and gave him a tumor 52 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

His eldest son was the famous Mandara
He fought Indra with the best of the great gods, Varshaarbuda 53 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The wheel of Vishnu and that terrible thunderbolt of the unbroken one
It was torn in the past, my dear, in the limbs of the planet, O Kesava 54 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The gods were being attacked by a very strong planet
The devas severely killed the boons given to them by Lord Shiva || 55 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Satisfied, he gave him the status of lord of the three worlds even to the lightning bolt
He became the lord of all the worlds for a hundred thousand years
You will always be my follower, he said 56 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

and the Lord gave him ten thousand sons
The divine unborn Lord gave him the island of Kusha by his kingdom || 57 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Similarly a great demon named Shatamukha was created by the creator
He who offered fire with his own flesh for a hundred years
Lord Shiva, satisfied, said to him, "What shall I do?" 58 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The hundred-faced Lord said to him, "Let me have a wonderful yoga
And strength, O best of the gods, grant me eternal strength 59 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Svayambhuva and Kratu also had a son in the past
Discovering himself by yoga for three hundred years || 60 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The god gave him a thousand sons worthy of sacrifice
You know the Lord of Yoga, the Deva-gita, Krishna, no doubt 61 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Valkhilyas were ignored by Maghava in the past
Lord Rudra was satisfied with the austerities of these angry men 62 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The best of the gods, the lord of the universe, pleased, addressed them as well
You will produce Garuda, the destroyer of the moon, by austerities 63 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The waters were lost in the past because of the wrath of Mahadeva
And those others were introduced by the seven-headed gods 64 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Atri's wife also left her husband and became a Brahmin
I shall never be subject to that sage again
Having said this she took refuge in Mahadeva || 65 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

She starved for three hundred years out of fear
She lay in the muscles for the grace of Bhava || 66 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Sandeva said to her, "You will have a son
but in your lineage he will go to the fame he desires by his own name 67 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Shakalya was a self-controlled man for nine hundred years
He worshiped Bhava by the sacrifice of his mind, O Kesava || 68 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The Lord said to him, "You will be satisfied and become a scribe
Your fame will be in the three worlds by the destruction of the calf
May your dynasty be inexhaustible and adorned by the great sages || 69 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Savarni was also a famous sage in the Kritayuga
Here he performed austerities for sixty hundred years || 70 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Lord Rudra said to him, "O sinless one, I am directly pleased with you
The author of the book will be famous in the world and will be immortal in old age 71 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And as I have seen the Lord of the gods, the Lord, in the past
He is the lord of the animals himself, my dear, and hear that too, O Madhava 72 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And for what purpose I have tried to do Mahadeva in the past
He was worshiped by the mighty and also hear in detail || 73 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And what I have received in the past from the gods and goddesses and the great Lord
I will tell you all that in its entirety today, O sinless one 74 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

In the past, in the Kritayuga, my dear son, there was a sage of great fame
He is known as Vyaghrapada and is well versed in the Vedic literature
I became his son and my younger brother Dhaumya || 75 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

After some time, Madhava, with Dhaumya
He came to the hermitage playing with the sages who were transcendental 76 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And there I saw a milking cow
I noticed the milk tasted like nectar 77 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then stir the dough with water, O Madhava
It is brought to us to drink as milk || 78 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then, my dear, I once ate cow's milk
Then the taste of the dough, my son, did not please me 79 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then I spoke to my childhood mother then
Give me food with milk and tears 80 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then my mother, overcome with grief and sorrow, spoke to me
She hugged him with affection for her son and kissed him on the forehead, Madhava 81 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Where, my son, is the milk of the sages who have become self-realized?
They lived in the forest and always ate tubers, roots and fruits 82 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Unpleasingly disfigured, bestower of boons, stable and inexhaustible
Where is the milk and the comfortable clothes, my child? 83 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Always surrender to him, my son, with all your heart, Lord Shiva
By His grace you will attain the fruits of your desires, my son || 84 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Hearing the words of his mother, he killed his enemies from that time on
My devotion to the great god became faithful || 85 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then I performed austerities and pleased Lord Shiva
He sat on the tip of his toes for a thousand divine years 86 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I then became a fruit-eater for a hundred years
the second is a decaying leaf eater and the third is a water-eater
I became a wind-eater for seven hundred years 87 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then pleased was Mahadeva, the lord of all the worlds
He assumed the form of Indra and was surrounded by all the gods
Then he became a thousand-eyed Vajrapani of great fame 88 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The sweet-smelling, red-eyed, stunned ears, and intoxicated
wrapped in hands, terrible, four-toothed, huge elephant 89 ||
[Nalyze Grammar]

The Lord stood there, glowing with His own effulgence
The crown came adorned with necklaces and bracelets 90 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He was wearing a white umbrella on his head
He was worshiped by the apsaras and sounded by the divine gandharvas || 91 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then the lord of the gods said to me, O best of the brāhmaṇas, I am pleased with you
Ask me for a boon that you have in mind 92 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

But I was not pleased to hear the words of Indra
Then I spoke these words to the king of the gods, O Krishna 93 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I desire no boon from you or from any other god
Except for Mahadeva, gentleman, I tell you this truth 94 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

By the words of the lord of the beasts I become immediately a worm or a tree with many branches
By the grace of the best of the animals, the glory of the kingdom of the three worlds is also undesirable to me 95 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Even if I become an insect or a moth by the command of Lord Shiva
But I do not desire, O Indra, even the three worlds which you have given me 96 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Until the moon, the lord of the animals, the Lord of my Lord, is pleased with the crown tied with the stain of the moon
Meanwhile I bear the pains of old age, death, birth and hundreds of blows imposed on my body 97 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Day, moon and fire, the essence of the three worlds, the infinite and original one
Who in this world can attain peace by appeasing the immortal and immortal Rudra? 98 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Indra said |
What is your reason again, O Lord, for cause and effect?
By which you desire no grace from anyone but the gods || 99 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Upamanyu said |
or by reasons or by others, the Lord is the cause and effect
We have not heard of any other linga being worshiped by the gods || 100 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Who else but the Lingam of all the gods, the Lord of the universe?
Whether it is worshiped or not worshiped before, tell me if you have a scripture 101 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

whose Brahma and Vishnu and you with the gods
Worship the Linga always, for he is the best of all 102 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Therefore I desire a boon or death, O Kausika
Go or stay, Indra, as you please, O destroyer of forces 103 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

May this desire be my boon or may it be a curse from the Lord
I do not desire any other goddess, nor do I desire the fruits of all my desires 104 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Having thus spoken to the lord of the gods his senses were agitated with grief
Rudra is not pleased with me thinking what is this
Then in an instant I saw him again || 105 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

---

It resembles the swan, the lotus and the moon, and the brightness of the lotus and the lily
He assumed the form of a bull and looked like a milky ocean 106 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He had a black tail and a huge body with honey-pink eyes
It is decorated with gold and ropes all over 107 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He had red eyes, a big nose, good ears and a good waist
He was well-sided, broad-shouldered, handsome and handsome 108 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

His hips appear to be filling his shoulders
like the peak of a snow mountain and like the peak of a white cloud || 109 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Lord of the gods stood there with Uma
The great god shone like the moon in the full moon 110 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

His brightness was like fire and clouds like thunder
It stands like a thousand suns covering everything || 111 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

God is very bright and like fire that consumes
At the end of the age he seemed to be urged to burn all beings || 112 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then it was covered with brightness and I could not see it from all sides
Again, my heart was troubled, and I wondered what this was 113 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

That effulgence spread in all ten directions like a moment
and calmed down in an instant by the illusion of the gods and goddesses || 114 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then I saw the Supreme Lord Maheshwara standing there
The gentle, smokeless fire in the Saurabheya
with the beautiful all-rounded Parvati, the Supreme Lord 115 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The blue-necked great soul is unattached to the treasure of effulgence
eighteen-armed, standing, adorned with all ornaments 116 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He is dressed in white robes and is anointed with white garlands
white flag, unbearable, white sacrificial veil 117 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Singing and dancing and jumping up and down
surrounded by divine councils of equal prowess || 118 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The crown of the young moon is white and rising like the autumn moon
Three eyes made him shine like three suns rising || 119 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The garland of the god shone white on his body
knotted with golden lotuses and adorned with gems || 120 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

They are idolized and the weapons are all-glorious
I have seen them, O Govinda, of the immeasurable splendor of Bhava 121 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The bow of that great soul was like a thousand weapons of Indra
It is known as Pinaka and it is a great serpent 122 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The seven-headed, huge-bodied, sharp-toothed, poisonous
The figure of a man standing with a great neck wrapped in a bow || 123 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The arrow was as bright as the sun and as bright as the fire of time
That weapon which is very terrible and divine is the great Pashupata || 124 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Unique, indescribable, and terrifying to all beings
It was as if it were emitting a huge body with sparks || 125 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

One-footed, great-toothed, with a thousand-headed belly
thousand-armed, tongue-eyed, as if burning like fire 126 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Brahman, Narayana, Indra, Agneya and Varuna
That which is distinctive, O mighty-armed one, is the destruction of all weapons 127 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

who burnt that Tripura to ashes in an instant in the past
By one arrow, O Govinda, by the play of Mahadeva || 128 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He burnt down the entire universe, the three worlds of moving and non-moving beings
No doubt it was released by the arms of Lord Maheshwara in half a minute || 129 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He who is not to be killed in this world even by Brahma, Vishnu and the demigods
That I saw, my father, was wonderfully wonderful and excellent 130 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

A secret weapon and beyond or equal to it
That which is known as the spear of the spearmen in all the worlds || 131 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

It will tear the whole earth or dry up the ocean
or destroy the whole world thrown by the spear in his hand || 132 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He who killed the young horse Mandhata the strong pुRA |
Chakravarti, the mighty, the conqueror of the three worlds, the king 133 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He is very strong and mighty and as mighty as Indra
By the hand of the demon, Govinda, the salt is here 134 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

That spear with a very sharp point was terrible and hair-raising
Trishikha frowned and stood as if threatening || 135 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Smokeless and dark with flames, it rose like the sun of darkness
The hand of a snake is indescribable, like the hand of a rope, death
I have seen that weapon, O Govinda, in the presence of Rudra 136 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The ax and sharp edge which were given to Rama in the past |
He was satisfied by Mahadeva and destroyed the Kshatriyas
He who killed Kartavirya, the emperor, in the great battle || 137 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He who made the earth devoid of kshatriyas three or seven times
By the son of Jamadagni, Govinda, by Rama, whose actions are effortless || 138 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He has a glowing edge and a fierce face and is wrapped around the tip of a snake's neck
He became like the flame of a blazing fire in the practice of the spear 139 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Innumerable weapons of his divine wisdom
I have mentioned these things to you in priority, O sinless one 140 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

On the left side of the god is Brahma, the father of the worlds
He boarded a divine plane with a swan-like speed of mind 141 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Narayana also stood on the left side
He mounted Vainateya and carried a conch, wheel and club 142 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Skanda stood near the goddess riding a peacock
Power in his neck like a second fire || 143 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I see Nandi of the god standing in front of me
standing with a spear in his hand, like a second Lord Shiva 144 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Svayambhu and other Manus and Bhrigu and other sages
Indra and other gods all came together || 145 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

They bowed and surrounded the great man from all sides
Then the devas praised the great god with various hymns || 146 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Brahma then praised Bhava and uttered the words between the chariots
Then Narayana chanted the eldest hymn to Lord of the gods
Indra chanted the supreme Brahman, the best of the hundred Rudras 147 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Brahma, Narayana and Kausika, the king of the gods
The great souls shone like three fires || 148 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Lord Shiva shone in the midst of them
The autumn clouds have been released and the sun has set
Then I praised the god of good vows with this hymn 149 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Obeisance to the Lord of the gods, the great God
O Indra, in the form of Indra, and dressed as Indra || 150 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

O thunderbolt-wielding, yellow and red, I offer my obeisances to you
O Pinaka-bearer, always holding a sword and a spear 151 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

O black-clad one with black curly hair, I offer my obeisances to you
He wore a black deerskin upper garment and a black eight-piece || 152 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

white in complexion and white in white clothes
smeared with white ashes and engaged in white deeds || 153 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

You are Brahma, the blue and red of all the gods and Rudras
And the Self of all beings is called the Purusha in Sankhya 154 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Thou art the bull of the holy yogis, the pure Shiva
You are the householder of the hermitages and the great lord of the gods
Kubera, you are called Vishnu of all the Yakshas and of the sacrifices 155 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The great mountain among mountains and the moon among stars
You are Vasishta, the sun among the sages and among the planets 156 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

You are the lion and the god of the beasts of the forest
You are the cow and bull of the villagers and the Lord is worshiped by the world 157 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

You are Vishnu among the suns and fire among the Vasus
Vainateya among birds and Ananta among serpents || 158 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The Sama Veda and the Yajur Veda are the hundred Rudriyas
Sanatkumara, you are Kapila among the yogis and among the Sankhyas 159 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

You are Indra among the Maruts, O lord of the ancestors, and you are the king of righteousness
Brahmaloka and the movements of the worlds are called Moksha 160 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

The Milky Way is the sea and the mountains are the Himalayas
You are a Brahmin among the varnas and an initiated Brahmin among the Brahmins
You are the beginning, the destroyer of the worlds and also time 161 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And whatever else in the worlds is considered to be more effulgent than Sattva
I am convinced that it is all about the Lord 162 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

O Lord, O compassionate devotee, I offer my obeisances to You
O Lord of Yoga, I offer my obeisances to You, O origin of the universe 163 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Have mercy on my devotee, the poor and the miserable
Be the eternal destination of the one who is endowed with wealthlessness || 164 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

and whom he has committed an offense out of ignorance, O Lord
O Lord of the gods, for being a devotee of Me, you should forgive all that 165 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I am also fascinated by the reversal of your appearance, O Lord of the gods
I offered him no arghya and no water for washing feet, O Lord of the gods 166 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Thus praising Lord Shiva I offered him water for washing feet and arghya with devotion
I wrapped my arms around him and told him everything 167 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then it was mixed with cold water and scented with divine fragrance
A good shower of flowers fell on my head, my dear 168 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then the divine drum was beaten by the servants of the gods
The wind blew holy, pure and pleasant 169 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then pleased was Mahadeva with his wife Vrishadhvaja
He spoke to the gods there as if to cheer me up then || 170 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Look at all the gods of the great Upamanyu
devotion to Me, supremely divine, dwelling in oneness 171 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Thus addressed, O Krishna, the demigods remained there by the trident-bearer
They all said with folded hands, bowing to the bull flag 172 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Lord of the gods and goddesses, Lord of the worlds, Lord of the universe
May they obtain the fruits of all their desires from you, O best of the Brāhmaṇas 173 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Thus addressed, Lord Shiva was then addressed by the demigods, Brahma and others
Lord Shiva said to me as if laughing 174 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I am pleased to be like a calf, O preeminent sage, look at me
You are a firm devotee, O sage among the brāhmaṇas, and I have inquired of you 175 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And with this devotion they are very pleasedManaham |
Therefore I grant you all your desires today as you desire || 176 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And when I was thus addressed by Mahadeva, O lord
Tears flowed from joy and hair grew 177 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Then I spoke to the god in a voice overwhelmed with joy

[Nalyze Grammer]

Today I was born, O Lord, and today my austerities have been successful
That the great god himself is pleased to stand before me || 179 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Whom the gods do not see and worship, for he is of immeasurable prowess
I have seen him, O God, and who else is more fortunate than I? 180 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Thus the learned meditate on the Supreme and Eternal Truth
It is known as the twenty-sixth, which is the supreme syllable 181 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He who created from the southern limb Brahma, the source of the worlds
From the left side also Lord Vishnu for the protection of the worlds
And at the end of the age, the Lord created Rudra from his body 183 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

That Rudra destroyed the entire universe, movable and immovable
Being time, he is as bright as fire, the converter 184 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

This is the god Mahadeva who created the universe of moving and non-moving beings
and at the end of the Kalpa it remains attracting the memory of all || 185 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

He is omnipresent, the Soul of all beings, and the origin of all beings
He remains omnipresent and eternally invisible to all the gods 186 ||

If a boon is to be given to me and if my Lord is pleased with me
May my devotion to You be eternal and eternal, O Lord Shiva 187 ||

By your grace, O best of the gods, I have the intelligence to know 188 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

I shall eat inexhaustible milk and bread with my relatives
May your presence always be supreme to me in the ashram 189 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Thus addressed the Lord, worshiped by the worlds, spoke to me
Maheshwara, the mighty, the effulgent, the teacher of all moving and non-moving beings, the Lord 190 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Be immortal and Chamara and free from suffering
He is virtuous, omniscient and pleasing to the eye 191 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

May you have inexhaustible youth and splendor like fire
The milky way and the ocean wherever you wish, O sage 192 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

There you will desire the presence of the treasure of milk
And eat milkshakes mixed with nectar 193 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

You will come to me with your relatives for a kalpa
I will always keep my presence in the ashram, O best of the Brāhmaṇas 194 ||

[Nalyze Grammer]

Having thus spoken the Supreme Personality of Godhead shone like a crore of suns
My Lord gave me the boon and disappeared from there 196 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And I have obtained all that the wise man said || 197 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

And directly to Thee, O Krishna, behold the perfected ones standing
the sages, the Vidyadharas, the Yakshas, ​​the Gandharvas and the Apsaras 198 ||
[Nalyze Grammer]

Look at the beautiful trees always full of flowers and fruits
They have smooth leaves and good branches with flowers of all seasons
All this, O mighty-armed one, is endowed with divine feelings 199 ||
