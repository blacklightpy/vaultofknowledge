		- Essenes (they believed the others corrupted the city and the Temple, and kinda followed the Oral Torah. They were Isolationists)
		- Sadducees (They wanted to be the priestly caste, and rejected the Oral Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim (and hence notions of afterlife and the Temple rites). They were the wealthy people.)
