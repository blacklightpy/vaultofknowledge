**Vedangas** are six auxiliary disciplines that are considered to be essential for the understanding and application of the Vedas.

The six Vedangas are **Siksha** (phonetics), **Chandas** (prosody / poetic meter), **Vyakarana** (grammar), **Nirukta** (etymology and linguistics), **Jyothisha** (astrology), and **Kalpa** (rituals and rites of passage).

**They are disciplines used to study the Vedas (limbs of the Vedas), not texts.**

Kalpa Vedanga studies gave rise to [[Dharma Sutras]] (alongside other Kalpa Sutras), which gave rise to [[Dharma Shastra]].
