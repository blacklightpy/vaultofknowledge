In addition to [[the Hebrew religion]], Christianity added the Gospel of Jesus.

The added books include:
- Deuterocanonical Books (by Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, but not Protestants or Jews)
- New Testament (by all Christians)

The Complete Bible was written by over 40 authors when inspired by The Holy Spirit.
