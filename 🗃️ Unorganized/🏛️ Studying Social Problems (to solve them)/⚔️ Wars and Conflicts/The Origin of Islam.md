> - Almohad Caliphate (Berbers, who defeated the Almoravid Dynasty)
> 	- dhimmis were rejected
> 	- Prior to Almohad rule, they had just had a Golden Age in Spain
> 		- The treatment and persecution of Jews under Almohad rule was a drastic change. Prior to Almohad rule during the Caliphate of Córdoba, Jewish culture experienced a Golden Age. María Rosa Menocal, a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University, has argued that "tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society", and that the **Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in Christian Europe**. Many Jews migrated to al-Andalus, where they were not just tolerated but allowed to practice their faith openly. Christians had also practiced their religion openly in Córdoba, and both Jews and Christians lived openly in Morocco as well. 
> 		- The first Almohad ruler, Abd al-Mumin, allowed an initial seven-month grace period. Then he forced most of the urban dhimmi population in Morocco, both Jewish and Christian, to convert to Islam. In 1198, the Almohad emir Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur decreed that Jews must wear a dark blue garb, with very large sleeves and a grotesquely oversized hat; his son altered the colour to yellow, a change that may have influenced Catholic ordinances some time later. Those who converted had to wear clothing that identified them as Jews since they were not regarded as sincere Muslims. Cases of mass martyrdom of Jews who refused to convert to Islam are recorded. The treatment and persecution of Christians under Almohad rule was a drastic change as well.
> 		- Many of the conversions were superficial. Maimonides urged Jews to choose the superficial conversion over martyrdom and argued, "Muslims know very well that we do not mean what we say, and that what we say is only to escape the ruler's punishment and to satisfy him with this simple confession."
> 	- Idris al-Ma'mun, a late Almohad pretender (ruled 1229–1232 in parts of Morocco), renounced much Almohad doctrine, including the identification of Ibn Tumart as the Mahdi, and the denial of dhimmi status. **He allowed Jews to practice their religion openly in Marrakesh and even allowed a Christian church there as part of his alliance with Castile**. In Iberia, Almohad rule collapsed in the 1200s and was succeeded by several "Taifa" kingdoms, which allowed Jews to practice their religion openly.

- Muslim Rulers who protected Jews: https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101019/http://mirajnews.com/article/opinion/muslim-rulers-saved-jews/

- Arab historians mention about 20 tribes who lived in the region, among them the well-known 
	- Banu-Nadir and Banu Qurayza who were called al-Kahinan, i.e., "Two Tribes of Priests,"
	- Banu Qaynuqa
	- Many Jews also lived in Khaybar and in other oases of Wadi al-Qura ("Valley of the Villages"), such as 
		- al-'Ula (Didan)
		- Mada'in Salih
		- al-Hijr, Fadak
		- the Transjordanian plains of Adhruḥ, Jarba, Edrei,
		- the port of Maqna on the Gulf of Eilat. 
	- Apparently, Jewish refugees from south Arabia also settled in the environs of Ta'if after the war of Yusuf Dhu Nuwas.
	- The reports from Medina attracted many Arab tribes who settled in this area, in particular two tribes from south Arabia, Banu al-Aws and Banu Khazraj, who from the start were vassals of the Jewish tribes. In the early seventh century they became stronger and the Jews were compelled to seek their protection.

> Judaism found its place in the Arabian Peninsula by immigration of Jews, which took place mainly during six periods:
> 
> - After the collapse of Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE.
> - After the Roman conquest of Judea.
> - After the Jewish rebellion in 66 CE, and the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 CE, exiles found a home in the desert.
> - Survivors of the Bar Kochba Revolt, in 135 CE, who sought religious freedom in the Arabian desert rather than live under the yoke of the Romans.
> - Immigration, around 300 CE, by people who are known in Islamic literature as the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj who fled the Ghassanids in Syria.
> - Migration from Judea into southern Arabian Peninsula to ride the ascent of the Himyarite Kingdom around 380 CE. Immigration to the Arabian Peninsula began in earnest in the 2nd century CE, and by the 6th and 7th centuries there was a considerable Jewish population in Hejaz, mostly in and around Medina. This was in part due to the embrace of Judaism by such leaders as Dhu Nuwas.

> # Jewish Tribes of Medina
> - Banu Alfageer: one of the Jewish tribes of Arabia during Muhammad’s era.
> - Banu Alkahinan:  patrilineal descent from the biblical Aaron (also Aharon), brother of Moses.
> - Banu Awf: One of the Jewish tribes of Arabia during Muhammad’s era. The Banu Awf: was an Arab tribe who wished to settle in the Jewish-ruled Tayma. The local people in Tayma insisted as a condition of settling in Tayma, Banu Awf must adopt Judaism. After having done so, they moved on to Yathrib.
> - Banu Aws: They fled Syria under Ghassanid rule, then fled Yathrib (presently known as Medina), and after expulsion by Muhammed, back to Syria.
> - Banu Harith: or Bnei Chorath were rulers of Najran.
> - Banu Nadir: Sub-clan of the al-Kāhinān, located in Yathrib (Medina). One of the three Jewish tribes that had settled in Medina before the rise of Islam in Arabia

> 
> ## Jews in Yemen
> 
> Yemenite Jewish traditions have traced the earliest settlement of Jews in this region back to the time of King Solomon. King Solomon sent Jewish merchant marines to Yemen to prospect for gold and silver with which to adorn the Temple in Jerusalem. The average Jewish population of Yemen for the first five centuries CE is said to have been about 3,000. Maimonides, the great rabbi and thinker of the 12th century, leader of Egyptian Jewry, wrote his famous Letter to Yemen. Emigration from Yemen to Palestine – then ruled by the Ottomom Empire – began in 1881 and continued almost without interruption until 1914.


> From: Wikipedia
> ### Sanaite
> 
> The Sanaite Jews have a tradition that their ancestors settled in Yemen forty-two years before the destruction of the First Temple. According to Jeremiah some 75,000 Jews, including priests and Levites, traveled to Yemen. The [Banu Habban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habbani_Jews "Habbani Jews") in southern Yemen have a tradition that they are the descendants of Judeans who settled in the area before the destruction of the Second Temple. These Judeans supposedly belonged to a brigade dispatched by King Herod to assist the Roman legions fighting in the region.
> 
> The [Himyarite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himyarite "Himyarite") royal family in exile commanded vast wealth and resources, particularly the [Nabatean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabatean "Nabatean") bedouin with whom they had controlled the market of trade by Land from North-East Africa for centuries.
> 
> By the close of the fifth century, the [Banu Aus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Aus "Banu Aus") and [Banu Khazraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Khazraj "Banu Khazraj") had become masters of [Yathrib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yathrib "Yathrib"). During these events, or possibly in coordination with them, Yathrib was host to a noble visitor. In 470 CE, Persian King Firuz was attempting to wipe out the Exilarchate. The [Exilarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exilarch "Exilarch") Huna V, who was the son of [Mar-Zutra bar Mar-Zutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-Zutra_III "Mar-Zutra III"), whisked his daughter and some of his entourage to [Yathrib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yathrib "Yathrib") (Medina) for safety.
> 
> ### Judaized Arabs and the Himyarite Kingdom
> 
> In about 400 CE, [Himyarite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himyarite "Himyarite") King _tubba Abu Karib As'ad Kamil_ (385-420 CE), a convert to Judaism, led military expeditions into central Arabia and expanded his empire to encompass most of the Arabian Peninsula. His army had marched north to battle the [Aksumites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksumite_Empire "Aksumite Empire") who had been fighting for control of Yemen for a hundred years. The Aksumites were only expelled from the region when the newly-Jewish king rallied Jews together from all over Arabia with pagan allies. The relationship between the Himyarite Kings and the polytheistic Arab tribes strengthened when, under the royal permission of Tubba' Abu Karib As'ad, [Qusai ibn Kilab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qusai_ibn_Kilab "Qusai ibn Kilab") (400–480 CE) reconstructed the [Ka'aba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%27aba "Ka'aba") from a state of decay, and had the Arab al-Kahinan ([Cohanim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohanim "Cohanim")) build their houses around it. Qusai ibn Kilab was the great-great- grandfather of [Shaiba ibn Hashim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiba_ibn_Hashim "Shaiba ibn Hashim") (Abdul-Mutallib). Shaiba ibn Hashim was fifth in the line of descent to Muhammad, and attained supreme power at Mecca. Qusai ibn Kilab is among the ancestors of [Sahaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahaba "Sahaba") and the progenitor of the [Banu Quraish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quraysh_(tribe) "Quraysh (tribe)"). When Qusai came of age, a man from the tribe of [Banu Khuza'a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Khuza%27a "Banu Khuza'a") named Hulail (Hillel) was the trustee of the Kaaba, and the Na'sa (Nasi)—authorized to calculate the calendar. Qusai married his daughter and, according to Hulail's will, obtained Hulail's rights to the Ka'aba. Hulail, according to Arabian tradition was a member of the [Banu Jurhum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurhum "Jurhum"). Banu Jurhum was a sub-group of the Banu [Qahtani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahtanite "Qahtanite") from whom the [Himyarites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himyarites "Himyarites") originally descend.
> 
> Around 455 CE, the last Himyarite King is born, _Zur'ah Yusuf Ibn Tuban As'ad Abu Kaleb Dhu Nuwas_ or [Dhu Nuwas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhu_Nuwas "Dhu Nuwas"). He died in 510. His zeal for Judaism brought about his fall. Having heard of the persecutions of Jews by Byzantine emperors, Dhu Nuwas retaliated by putting to death some Byzantine merchants who were traveling on business through Himyara. He didn't simply kill them with hanging—he burned them in large pits—earning him the title "King of the burning pit".
> 
> These killings destroyed the trade of Yemen with Europe and involved Dhu Nuwas in a war with the heathen King Aidug, whose commercial interests were injured by these killings. Dhu Nuwas was defeated, then he made war against the Christian city Najran in Yemen, which was a dependency of his kingdom. After its surrender, he offered the citizens the alternative of embracing Judaism, under coercion, or being put to death. As they refused to renounce their faith, he executed their chief, Harith ibn Kaleb, and three hundred and forty chosen men.


> Sabaean Kingdom (Arab kingdom of Saba / Biblican Kingdom of Sheba) (1200 BCE–275 CE) > Himyarite Dynasty (110 BC-525 CE) > Aksum/Axum Dynasty (525-578) > Persian Sassanian Empire (224-651) > Rashidun Caliphate of Islam


> Immigration to the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula") began in earnest in the 2nd century CE, and by the 6th and 7th centuries there was a considerable Jewish population in [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz"), mostly in and around [Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina "Medina"). This was in part due to the embrace of Judaism by such leaders as [Dhu Nuwas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhu_Nuwas "Dhu Nuwas"); who was very aggressive about converting his subjects to Judaism. Nuwas persecuted [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") in his kingdom as a reaction to the [Christian persecution of Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews "Persecution of Jews") by the local Christians and [Abu Karib Asad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubba_Abu_Karab_As%27ad "Tubba Abu Karab As'ad"). In 523, the Himyarite king [Dhu Nuwas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhu_Nuwas "Dhu Nuwas") (Dunaan), who had converted to Judaism, massacred the Christians there.
> 
> # Najran community
> There was a small Jewish community, mostly members of [Bnei Chorath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bnei_Chorath "Bnei Chorath"), in one border city from 1934 until 1950. The city of [Najran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najran "Najran") was liberated by Saudi forces in 1934 after it been conquered by Yemenis in 1933, thus absorbing its Jewish community, which dates to pre-Islamic times. With increased persecution, the Jews of Najran made plans to evacuate. The local governor at the time, Amir Turki ben Mahdi, allowed the 600 Najrani Jews a single day on which to either evacuate or never leave again. Saudi soldiers accompanied them to the Yemeni border. These Jews arrived in [Saada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saada "Saada"), and some 200 continued south to [Aden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden") between September and October 1949. The Saudi [King Abdulaziz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud_of_Saudi_Arabia "Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia") demanded their return, but the Yemeni king, [Ahmad bin Yahya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_bin_Yahya "Ahmad bin Yahya") refused, because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. After settling in the Hashid Camp (also called Mahane Geula) they were airlifted to Israel as part of the larger [Operation Magic Carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Magic_Carpet_(Yemen) "Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)").
> 
> Some groups of Najran Jews escaped to Cochin, as they had very good relationship with the rulers of Cochin and maintained trade connections with [Paradesi Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradesi_Jews "Paradesi Jews").
> 
> According to [Yemenite Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenite_Jews "Yemenite Jews") tradition, the Jews of Najran traced their origin to the [Ten Tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Lost_Tribes "Ten Lost Tribes").


> - The Medinese, which consisted of Aws and Khazraj, along with their Jewish allies, Banu Nadir, Banu Qurayza, and Banu Qaynuqa, were involved in degenerating years of warfare such as battle of Sumair, battle of Banu Jahjaha of Aus-Banu Mazin of Khazraj, battle of Sararah day, battle of Banu Wa'il ibn Zayd, battle of Zhufr-Malik, battle of Fari', battle of Hathib, battle of Rabi' day, first battle of Fijar in Yathrib (not Fijar war between Qays with Kinana in Mecca), battle of Ma'is, battle of Mudharras, and second battle of Fijar in Yathrib. The Medinese also even contacted against foreign invaders came from outside Hejaz, including such as Shapur II of Sasanian Empire in relatively vague result, and also in successful defense against Himyarite Kingdom under their sovereign, Tabban Abu Karib, who also known as Dhu al-Adh'ar. However, the most terrible conflict for both Aws and Khazraj were a civil war called the battle of Bu'ath, which leave bitter taste for both clans, and caused them to grew weary of war, due to the exceptionally high level of violence, even by their standards, and the needless massacres that occurred during that battle.


> ### Early history and Jewish control
> 
> Medina has been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BCE. By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"), and there were three prominent [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_tribes_of_Arabia "Jewish tribes of Arabia") [tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_tribes_that_interacted_with_Muhammad "Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad") that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the [Banu Qaynuqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qaynuqa "Banu Qaynuqa"), the [Banu Qurayza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza "Banu Qurayza"), and [Banu Nadir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Nadir "Banu Nadir"). [Ibn Khordadbeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khordadbeh "Ibn Khordadbeh") later reported that during the [Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iran "History of Iran")'s domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as [tax collectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_collector "Tax collector") for the Persian [Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah "Shah").
> 
> The situation changed after the arrival of two new [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") tribes, the ['Aws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Aws "Banu Aws") or Banu 'Aws and the [Khazraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazraj "Khazraj"), also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but they later revolted and became independent.
> ### Under the 'Aws and Khazraj
> 
> Toward the end of the 5th century,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina#cite_note-19) the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The [Jewish Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Encyclopedia "Jewish Encyclopedia") states that "by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.
> 
> Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj.
> 
> Eventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [Hijrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(Islam) "Hijra (Islam)") (emigration) to Medina in 622, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies. The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. They fought a total of four wars.
> 
> Their last and bloodiest known battle was the [Battle of Bu'ath](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bu%27ath&action=edit&redlink=1 "Battle of Bu'ath (page does not exist)"), fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued.

---

- The Jews of Medina were probably Jews expelled from Roman Palestine (more accurate sources in the rough notes above)
- While at Medina, according to the Quran, the prophet declared a treaty, "The Constitution of Medina"
	- The contract upheld peace between Jews, Christians (other "People of the Book") and Muslims, defining them all, under given conditions, as the "community" of Medina, and granting all of them freedom of religious thought and practice.
	- **Rights of Non-Muslims according to the constitution:**
		- The security of God is equal for all groups.
		- Non-Muslim members have the same political and cultural rights as Muslims. They have autonomy and freedom of religion.
		- Non-Muslims take up arms against the enemy of the nation and share the cost of war. There is to be no treachery between the two.
		- Non-Muslims are not obliged to take part in the Muslims' religious wars.
- The Three Jewish tribes in Medina were: Banu Qurayza, Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Al-Nadir
- The Terms of the Covenant and their Breach of It (Tafsir of Quran 2:84-2:86) [citing the Quran is ok here, since the general argument is that Quran incites violence]
	- Allah criticized the Jews who lived in Al-Madinah (Medina) at the time.
	- They used to suffer, because of the armed conflicts between the tribes Aws and Khazraj
	- Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Al-Nadir were allies of the Khazraj
	- Banu Qurayza used to be the allies of Aws
	- When in war, both tribes would fight for their allies. And during war, they would kill the Arab enemies, and they would also kill Jews who were allies of the other tribe, although the Jews were prohibited from killing each other according to their books.
	- They would also drive each other from their homes and loot all the furniture they could.
	- But at the end of the war, they would release the prisoners of the defeated party, according to the Tawrah.
	- Tawrah said: Do not kill each other, nor expel one another from their homes, nor participate in fighting against them.
	- During the "Battle of Bu'ath", the Jewish tribes would fight among themselves, while the Aws and Khazraj were polytheists who worshipped idols, and did not know about Paradise, the Fire, Resurrection, the Divine Books, the lawful and the prohibited.
	- At the end of the war, they would ransom the prisoners according to the Tawrah, and also ask for blood money.
	- Allah reminded that they ignore the Tawrah when it said you to not kill your members or expel them from their homes, and follow it to implement ransom. By this, they believe one part of the scripture and reject the rest. "You do this all to acquire the life of this world".
	- For this, the 'noble Ayat' criticized the Jews, and said that they must not be trusted to preserve the Torah or to say the truth about the prophet, his coming, his expulsion, etc.
	- On the Day of Resurrection, they will be subject to torment because they defied the book they were given.
- The Terms of the Covenant and their Breach of It (Tafsir of Quran 2:87-2:86)
	- The Tawrah was revealed to Musa (Moses), but they distorted it's meaning to fulfil their fantasies
	- So Allah sent Isa (Jesus), and sent miracles to support him, but Jews didn't want to differ from a single word
	- This way, they killed or rejected all Prophets
	- This happened because they altered the Tawrah, and the prophets upheld the truths which clashed with their desires
- 624 AD: Meccans of Banu Quraysh was defeated in the "Battle of Badr"
- Battle of Uhud soon ensued, in which Mohammed was defeated by the Quraysh. After returning to Medina, the Jewish tribes would make fun of him for the defeat.
- A dispute broke up between the Muslims and Banu Qaynuqa
	- It is said that a jeweller from Banu Qaynuqa asked a woman to reveal her hair, and he pinned her dress so when she got up, she was stripped naked. A Muslim man killed the jeweller in retaliation.
		- This story has been debated by many people. Nevertheless, this is the story.
		- Some say that Mohammed decided to eliminate Jews after being strengthened by his victory.
	- Prophet Mohammed warned them to be fair, or else, they'll suffer the same fate as Quraysh. He also asked them to follow the true word of god. But Banu Qaynuqa mocked his followers for accepting him as the prophet and mocked their victory claiming Quraysh had no knowledge of war, and if you fight with us, we'll show you who's boss. So this was seen as a declaration of war.
	- The Banu Qaynuqa tribes were defeated and exiled.
- 625 AD: Banu Nadir tribe was evicted from Medina for trying to assassinate prophet Mohammed.
- 627 AD: Banu Quraysh (of Mecca) and their allies besieged the city of Medina in the "Battle of Trench". Banu Qurayza initially tried to stay neutral, but they entered into negotiations with the besieging army.
	- They dug trenches to keep the Meccans away, so it's called the Battle of the Trench
	- The Meccans came with the support of the other two exiled Jewish tribes, and sent envoys to gain the support of the Banu Qurayza
	- The Banu Qurayza was hesitant, but when a large Meccan army arrived, they joined in
	- Mohammed tried to make diplomatic efforts to keep Banu Qurayza on their side
	- But by the third week, Banu Qurayza decided to act against Mohammed, although they had demanded hostages from the Meccans to ensure they wouldn't be left to face Mohammed alone
	- But they didn't get any hostages because the Meccans were exhausted, and soon cold and heavy rains set in, and the Meccans marched home to the horror and dismay of Banu Qurayza
	- This betrayal was considered a violation of the "Constitution of Medina".
	- The Muslims commenced a 25-day siege against they Banu Qurayza's fortress. Finally both sides agreed to an arbitration.
	- The chosen judge was a former ally of Banu Qurayza, Sa'd ibn Muadh, who was now a Muslim. Sa'd was wounded in battle and would soon die.
