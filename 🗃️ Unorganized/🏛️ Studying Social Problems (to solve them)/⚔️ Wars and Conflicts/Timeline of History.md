"A man (or woman) becomes a hero only after he's dead. When he's alive, you can't see the divinity in him (or her), as a person among us, so you elevate them after their deaths." (The prophets; only older prophets, not modern day prophets.)

"Each religion presents history in their own manner in the name of god's will, so how convenient is it to present themselves as right in history? To all believers, they are the ones who are right."

Also, the Jews didn't agree with Muslims because his teachings differed from their own scriptures. How convenient is it to then reject the interpretation of what's true by rejecting anything that deviates from the previous model? It is one thing to say they don't believe it, and another to say that it deviates from the scriptures. If it didn't deviate from the scriptures, it'd be the same, isn't it? I'd say the same is true for Muslims, because now they too will not believe in anything besides their scriptures. [Verify context of deviation and decide if you need this.]

- Lambda-CDM Model of the Big Bang Theory
(don't go too far Jyothish)
Firstly, our models of physical cosmology has consensus on the Lambda-CDM parametrization of the Big Bang Theory, based on QFT and General Relativity. The parts beyond physics (meta-physics) are the subject of religions and philosophy. I don't think we disagree on physical cosmology, but some people seem to do. But I'll be skipping that part, and focusing only on the human civilizations. So we had the solar system form, the Cambrian explosion happen and the evolution of mammals.

Now, the history of human civilization can be mapped to the oldest known traces, or the cradles of civilization.

With agriculture, food became more reliable, but less varied, and people became more prone to diseases, and settling together made diseases easier to spread.

# Prehistory
[Stone Age] - Palaeolithic and Neolithic
- People spread everywhere across Europe, Africa and Asia
- 55000 BC: Australian aboriginals were found in this period
[Last Ice Age]
- People travelled from Asia to Americas through the bridge
- Neolithic Revolution (or the First Agricultural Revolution) in the West Asian Fertile Crescent saw the transition from hunting and gathereing to agriculture and settlements

# Holocene Epoch Begins
# 6-3 Millenia BC (5400-2350 BC)
- 5400 BC: Sumerian settlements begin
- 8000 BC: Neolithic settlements
- 6000 BC: Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt
[5000 BC: Chalcolithic Age]
- Mesopotamia was the site of the earliest civilizations
	- It was the Greek name for the valley between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris in modern day Iraq.
	- Mesopotamia and the Levant comprised the Fertile Crescent
	- 4100 BC: The first "civilization" in Mesopotamia was that of Sumer, during the Uruk Period
- 3500 BC Indo-European nomads from the European steppe learn to tame horses and cattle, which helped during the Piora Oscillation, a cold period post the Holocene Climatic Optimum
	- The Piora Oscillation is also associated with the climate changes at the end of the Uruk Period, and with the Flood of Noah in the Book of Genesis and the floods in the Epic of Gilgamesh
[3300 BC Bronze Age]
- Nile Valley Civilization (Egypt)
- 2200 BC: The Indo-Europeans learn how to put wheels on horses
- North China Plain Civilization (Eastern China)
