Today I'll be criticizing the YouTube account holder: Esch•a•ton

He's posted two videos:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swEp2QDXrk8 (Title: This Argument for God Causes Mental Terrorism (Warning: Heavy Philosophy))
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qherWYjWVK8 (Title: This Proves the Christian God isn’t Who You Think He Is…)
# The Argument

## Brief
Aside from the firstly clickbait title, "mental terrorism" and "heavy philosophy", to a seasoned philosopher like me, I did not feel that the argument made any real sense, aside from that it took some interesting turns.

In the first video, he made an ontological argument for the existence of God, and described that it is impossible for a being such as God to not exist, and that God had to be personal. While I don't agree with his idea that God has to be greater and personal, I can come to the rest of it, that God should exist, using a simpler argument.

In the second video, he claims that the Christian God, as described in the Bible is the same God as he described in the first video, and that Christians largely misunderstand this, and
