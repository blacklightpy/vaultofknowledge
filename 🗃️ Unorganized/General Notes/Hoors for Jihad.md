I FINALLY FOUND IT FROM SAHEEH AL-BUKHARI (They hid it in Arabic)

- Sahih al-Bukhari Book 56: Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad)
	- Chapter 6: بَابُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ وَصِفَتُهُنَّ (Al-Hur-ul-'Ein Wasifatuhuna, "Beautiful Eyed Maidens and their description")
		- Description 1: يَحَارُ فِيهَا الطَّرْفُ شَدِيدَةُ سَوَادِ الْعَيْنِ شَدِيدَةُ بَيَاضِ الْعَيْنِ (The gaze is dazzled by them, their eyes are very black, their eyes are very white)
		- Description 2: {وَزَوَّجْنَاهُمْ} أَنْكَحْنَاهُمْ. ({And We married them} We married them)

I found IslamQA bullshit: https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25843/objection-to-the-fact-that-a-man-will-have-hoor-iyn-who-will-share-her-husband-with-her

Apparently, it's only confirmed that most will get at least two, while Mujahids will get 72

> Abu Na’eem narrated in Sifat al-Jannah from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will go to one hundred virgins in one day – i.e., in Paradise.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 367.

> Anas narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said: "The believer shall be given in paradise such and such strength in intercourse ." it was said: "O Messenger of Allah! And will he able to do that?" He said: "He will be given the strength of a hundred."
> Hasan by Darussalam, Saheeh by Al-Albani in Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2536
## Women's Jealousy (LOL)

> The misunderstanding is when the questioner says: “This to me does not seem like a fair concept for the women, to share their husbands in this way.” 
> 
> Fairness or justice is to be found in the rulings of sharee’ah, not in what a person thinks who does not know sharee’ah and its rulings, let alone the reasons behind them. 
> 
> The sister who is asking this question thinks that the jealousy in her heart, and what it leads to of depression and sorrow will remain with her in Paradise, but this is not correct, and this is why there is this misunderstanding in her question.  
> 
> Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
> 
> “And We shall remove from their breasts any (mutual) hatred or sense of injury (which they had, if at all, in the life of this world); rivers flowing under them, and they will say: ‘All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.’ And it will be cried out to them: ‘This is the Paradise which you have inherited for what you used to do’”
> 
> [al-A’raaf 7:43]
> 
> There is nothing but joy and happiness in Paradise; there is no room for hatred and rancour in the hearts of the people of Paradise. Al-hoor al-‘iyn are something which Allah has created to honour the people of Paradise and to increase their delight. Moreover a man will be given the strength of one hundred men for intercourse, so the large number will not have any effect on a woman, and her feelings towards her co-wives and her husband’s concubines will not be like her feelings in this world.

> It was narrated that Zayd ibn Arqam said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me: “A man in Paradise will be given the strength of one hundred men in eating, drinking, desire and intercourse.” A Jewish man said: “The one who eats and drinks will need to relieve himself.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “The way in which one of them will relieve himself will be by means of sweat which will come out through his pores, and thus the food in his stomach will be digested.”

> “Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith?”
