But when it comes to religion, the interpretations of certain people pose a threat. And by the probability that I have mentioned above.

A text that is from an intelligent source, and advocates for the well-being of sentient beings will not have such a large semantic distance.


I know it is a bad time for Muslims, but the thing is, it's always a bad time for Muslims, because they always want to cause problems for non-Muslims. Oh, not the individuals, just a few in the community.
