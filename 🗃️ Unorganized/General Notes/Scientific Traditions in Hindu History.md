They don't always provide proofs for mathematical formulae, or rigorous formulas for physical observations. Nevertheless, they were good philosophical observations that did have a lot of meaning aside from just voodoo.
# From Baudhaayana Shulba Sutras
The Baudhaayana Shulba Sutras of the Tattiriya Shaakha, of Krisha Yajur Veda had aphorisms on the following mathematical theorems:

1. Pythagorean Theorem's proof and Triplets
	- Proof
		- **Reference:** Baudhaayana Shulba Sutra > Verse 1.12
			- Shulba Sutras are rope measurement techniques
			- They deal with design of altars for religious rites
			- This part was dealing with the construction of Mahaa Vedi, a sacrificial altar
			- Measurements of Vedis and Yoopas were critical to religion, for sanctity
		- **Sanskrit:**
			- दीर्घचतुरस्रस्याक्ष्णया रज्जुः पार्श्वमानी तिर्यग् मानी
			  च यत् पृथग् भूते कुरूतस्तदुभयं करोति ॥
		- **Transliteration:**
			- deergha chatursrasyaakshanayaa rajjuh paarshvamaanee, tiryagmaanee,
			  cha yatprthagbhoote kurutastadubhayaan karoti.
		- **Translation:**
			- The diagonal of an oblong produces by itself both the areas which the two sides of the oblong produce separately.
	- Triplets
		- **Reference:** Baudhaayana Shulba Sutra > Verse 1.13
		- **Sanskrit:**
			- 
		- **Transliteration:**
			- tāsāṃ trika-catuskayār-dvādaśika-pañcikayāḥ pañca-daśikāṣṭikāyāḥ saptaka-catu-viṃśikayār-dvādaśika-pañcātriṃśikayāḥ pañca-daśikāṣṭi-triśikayārityāsu-upaladhāḥ
		- **Translation:**
			- This verse basically lists out a bunch of values for which the rule had been found to hold. These include (3, 4),  (12, 5), (15, 8), (7, 24), (12, 35) and (15, 36).
2. Digits of $\pi$
	- It was calculated as $(\frac{6}{2+\sqrt{2}})^2 = 3.088311...$ (no decimal points right)
	- They tried to use some patterns, but indeed, $\pi$ is irrational.
3. Circling the Square and Squaring the Circle
