Our philosophy is that we will have to kill you.
Please let us reside in your lands, we will not kill you now.
We will only kill you when we have enough power to do so.
For now, we are at peace.

We are allowed to break any indefinite term treaty without cause.
But we are also allowed to make treaties if it is convenient for us.
Our mission is to kill all those who do not join us.
But we also like to spread across the world, and avoid being killed.

We are also allowed to lie to those who we have to kill for strategy.
But there are rules on the circumstances in which we can lie.
We can always refuse to give them the entire context. **(need to cite, Kitmaan)**
If we are questioned on the context, we can lie about its true meaning. **(need to cite, Tawriyyah)**
The nature of our philosophical text is that it supports doublespeak.
We can live using loopholes justifiable to blend in with other. **(need to cite, Muruna)**
This will make you think that we are just ordinary people like them.
This way, we can make them join us, after which, they cannot leave alive.
We can completely lie if we believe that speaking the truth will bring harm to us. **(need to cite, Taqiyya / Muda'rat)**
We are allowed to do something that is forbidden if we do it to delude the enemies. **(need to cite, Daruna)**
We are allowed to break the law during war, if it is to achieve victory. **(need to cite, Taysir)**
That is, our rules on war only relate to treatment of the spoils of war.
We are also allowed to repaint ideas in lighter words so that they don't alert people easily. **(need to cite, Hiyal)**


There are some who think that they are among us but are not.
They will say that we do not wish to kill those who do not join us.
But they are disbelievers who follow their humanity instead.
If they are not just lying strategically, they too should be killed.

But we are not telling you that we will have to kill you.
Our philosophy does contain that we are supposed to kill you.
But our philosophy is something that we share amongst ourselves.
Your people support free speech, which lets us do what we want.
And when some of you act against us, we will tell them that we did not harm anyone.
