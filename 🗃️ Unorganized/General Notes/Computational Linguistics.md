It is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the computational modelling of [[natural language]].

[[Avram Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] said [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] were the pioneers in computational linguistics.

Leibniz proposed the [[Characteristica Universalis]] and the [[Alphabet of Human Thought]] which were a part of his idea of creating a language in which grammar and logic would coincide, allowing reasoning to be reduced to calculation.
