An individual is one that exists as a distinct [[entity]].

Individuality (or self-hood) is the state or quality of living as an individual; particularly (in the case of humans) as a person unique from other people and possessing one's own [[needs]] or [[goals]], [[rights]] and [[responsibilities]].
