### Jealous Visiting God (Abrahamic)

EDIT: Now it's of the form (Culture includes Metaphysics). I got to change it to (Culture believes Metaphysics that describes the Culture).

- "**Adherence**" to the "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" "**Prescribed**" by "**God**" which includes "**Worship**" of "**A Jealous God**" who "**Governs**" the "**World**" and will bring "**Eternal**" "**World**" "**Peace**" (==Judaism / Way of the Yehudis==)
- "**Humans**" are created as "**Sinners**" by "**Nature**" because their "**Original Ancestors**" chose to disobey "**God**" by committing the "**Original Sin**", which happened according to the "**Plan**" of "**God**" (because he is "**All Knowing**"), for which the "**Punishment**" is "**Death**" and "**Eternal Torture**" in "**Hell**", and the "**Original Sin**" is "**Inherited**" by "**All Humans**" and the "**Only Way**" of "**Salvation**" is "**Belief**" in the "**Sinless Sacrifice**" (i.e. not suicide) of a "**Sinless Man**" (who would thus be the "**Christ**") who "**Took On**" the "**Punishment**" for the "**Sins**" of "**Everyone**", by being "**Punished**" "**Unjustly**" by "**Some**" "**People**" based on their "**Man-Made**" and "**Corrupt**" "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" for the supposed crime of "**Rebelling**" to "**Undo**" "**Man-Made**" "**Corruptions**" to the "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" "**Prescribed**" by "**God**" which includes "**Worship**" of "**A Jealous God**" who "**Governs**" the "**World**" and "**Eternal**" "**Afterlife**" in "**Heaven**" or "**Hell**" following the "**Destruction**" of the "**World**" (==Christianity / Faith in Christ==)
- "**Adherence**" to the "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" "**Prescribed**" by "**God**" which includes "**Worship**" of "**A Jealous God**" who "**Owns**" the "**World**" and "**Eternal**" "**Afterlife**" in "**Heaven**" or "**Hell**" following the "**Destruction**" of the "**World**" and "**Ensuring**" the "**Establishment**" of that "**Moral Law**" all over the "**World**", where "**People**" have "**Discarded**" it to instead follow their "**Man-Made**" and "**Corrupt**" "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" by "**Discourse**" or "**Physical Force**" with proper "**Strategies**" to "**Undo**" "**Man-Made**" "**Corruptions**" to the "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" with an "**Exception**" to those who do not "**Trigger**" the "**Jealousy**" of "**God**" who can live by providing "**Protection**" "**Tax**" to the "**Righteous**" followers as form of "**Humiliation**" for adhering to their "**Man-Made**" and "**Corrupt**" "**Moral Law**" and "**Way of Life**" (==Mohammedan Islam according to Ahl as-Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah / Submission to God according to Mohammed according to the People of Tradition and the Majority of Muslims==)

### Non-Jealous Visiting God
### Non-Visiting God / Deistic
- (==Yoga Darshana of Vedic Hinduism / The Perspective of Seeking Connection with Nature from the Beliefs of Indians following the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge==)
## Dualistic Polytheism
### Monolatrous
### Non-Monolatrous
## Dualistic Henotheism
- Worship of One God and many deities
## Dualistic Atheism
- There is "**No God**", and "**Reality**" simply consists of two "**Eternal**" things - a "**Witness Consciousness**" and a "**Physical World**", where "**You**" are the "**Eternal**" and "**Formless**" "**Witness Consciousness**" "**Trapped**" in the "**Temporary**" "**Cyclic Worldly Existence**" that takes place in the "**Eternal**" "**Physical World**" which **Continually Evolves**" its "**State**" through the "**Cycle of Life**" just for the sake of "**Your**" "**Mental Evolution**", due to your "**Misunderstanding**" of "**Reality**" that acts as a "**Veil**" to your complete "**Realization**" and makes you think that "**You**" are a part of this "**Cyclic Worldly Existence**", when in reality "**You**" are only a "**Witness Consciousness**" that is "**Separate**" from the "**Physical World**", and when you realize that, the "**Physical World**" will "**Cease**" to "**Evolve**" "**Further**" for "**You**" and you will be free. (==Sankhya Darshana of Vedic Hinduism / Digital Perspective of the Indians following the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge==)
- "**Existence**" is a "**Random Occurrence**" with "**No Guarantee**" on "**Non-Existent Concepts**" such as "**Justice**" (==Classical Nihilism==)

> [!NOTE]
> # Trying to Define Indian Beliefs in English
> ## Me Trying to Define Them Purely in English
> Hell, I'll tell you this was hard.
> 
> I started like:
> - X Perspective of the Beliefs of Indians following the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge
> 
> But it sucked. Then I wrote it down like:
> - Vedic Hinduism (Beliefs of Indians following the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge)
> - X Darshana of Vedic Hinduism (X Perspective of Indians following the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge)
> 
> Then I tried an alternative:
> - Islam (Submission)
> - X Aqeedah  (X Perspective on How to Follow Submission)
> - (X Perspective of People who Follow Submission)
> - (X Perspective on Following Submission)
> 
> Then I tried:
> - (Beliefs of Xs who Follow Y)
> - (A Perspective of Following Y according to Xs)
> - (A Perspective of Xs Following Y)
> 
> - Finally I realized that I should understand that there is an ontological difference between:
> 	- "Hinduism" (A Western Grouping that literally means the "Beliefs of Indians EXCLUDING Muslims, Christians, Jews and Parsis") and
> 	- "Perspectives of Indians" (The True Classification)
> 
> To fix this, I realized I had to consider Indian Muslims as Hindus. Then, I had to break down the term into the concept, and translate it accordingly.
> 
> e.g. "Digital Perspective of Indians who follow the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge" and "The Perspective of Seeking Connection with Nature according to Indians who follow the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge"
> 
> - Better Ways
> 	- New Form: "The Perspective that the Summary of the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge posits a Difference and Non-Difference"
> 	- Old Form: "The Perspective of following the Summary of Sanskrit Books of Knowledge that posits a Difference and Non-Difference according to Indians who follow the Sanskrit Books of Knowledge"
> 
> (It's called "Indians who" rather than those "who" because I'm sticking to a literal translation rather than an ideological one).
> ## How The Westerners Probably Defined
> - Westerners: "These are "Indian Beliefs""
> - Westerners: "They say they have different perspectives"
> - Westerners: "Some have different perspectives based on Vedas (Sanskrit Books of Knowledge)" (Six Broad Perspectives)
> - Westerners: "Others have free perspectives" (Buddhism, Jainism, etc.)
> - Westerners: "These are perspectives of the Indians": *defines them*
> - Westerners: "And we'll call the people of the land Hindus"
> - Westerners: "But we'll only use the term to describe people of their native beliefs"
> - Westerners: "And we'll call the others in the land separately" (Muslims, Christians)
> Why? Here's my guess:
> - "These Indians aside from Muslims and Christians rely on priests to know their culture"
> - "We can't fool the Muslims and Christians, but we can fool the others and take over this place"
> - "Let's translate their books and make our compilation more accessible"
> - "Let's then make them all believe that this compilation is their divine truth"
> - "Let's prioritize the worst texts they have to sow discord in the community" (Manu Smriti, Vaishnava Dharma Shastra)
> - "Let's feed on their pride and make the thinking priestly classes feel superior in a divine right"
> - "Let's make the working classes who don't think too much feel oppressed by the corrupt priestly class"
> - "Let's make the working class people finally fight the priestly class to gain freedom"
> - "And then let's take charge of this nation in the name of fixing their divisiveness"
> # To Classify
> I will define a Hindu as an Indian, based on Geography. (Hindu <= Sindhu River)
> Hindus have different perspectives.
> 
> Some follow Vedas (Sanskrit Books of Knowledge) (from it some follow some sects)
> Some follow Other Stuff
> Some follow Islam
> Some follow Christianity
> Some follow Judaism
> Some are just crazy (Polytheism, Atheism, Strange Rituals)
