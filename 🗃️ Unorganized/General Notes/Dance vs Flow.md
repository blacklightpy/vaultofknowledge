A dance is one in which the flow is broken, by intent, but not by conscious thought. In that it follows the flow of sensation, but not of the physical forces.

Meanwhile, a flow is something which follows the laws of physics purely, and does not make use of an active intelligence at any point, aside from the one that caused its initial motion.
