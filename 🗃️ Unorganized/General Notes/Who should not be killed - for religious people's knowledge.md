# 1. If some gay people are in a relationship, they should not be killed

Such a relationship cannot be described as sexual, but only as sensual.

A sensual relationship is one where two people engage in activities such as kissing, fondling body parts and stimulating sensitive body parts

Sexual intercourse is one where a male (carrier of semen) stimulates his penis against a female (carrier of womb). Sexual intercourse is a special action because it can lead to pregnancy. Therefore sexual intercourse can be done for functional or sensual purposes. If the stimulation leads to ejaculation of semen inside the vagina, and that finds its way into the ovary, then it's a complete sexual intercourse.

There is no such thing as a sexual relationship.

There are only relationships where people are simply connected, people meet each other, people engage in sensual intimacy and those who engage in sensual intimacy for the sake of religion.
# 2. If a partner has sensual relationships with another person, they or their second partner should not be killed

This happens due the patriarchal idea that women are the property of their partners in the sensual relationship assigned by religious ceremony to be used for the purposes of generating children and experiencing sensual desires.

Under this belief system, when a male finds his partner taking part in a sensual relationship with another male, he feels like he's been turned into a cuckold, a term for a man who's personal property is used by other men so that he gets the leftovers.

They think of a woman, who is a person, as nothing more than property, and further a woman who's had sensual intimacy with another person as the same as food that's mixed with another man's saliva, carrying bacteria that is not healthy for anyone else.

They are total fools who do not understand context, and their brains cannot bend enough to understand complex concepts, including matters of human relationships.
# 3. If someone leaves a religion, they should not be killed
