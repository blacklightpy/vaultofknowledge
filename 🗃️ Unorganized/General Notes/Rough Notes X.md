# Lies that Muslims say
- Killing a person is as though killing all humanity (covered in problems section)
	- Except for spreading mischief

	- and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, vol. 4 (Surat 7-10)
	  
	  These cover such topics as deceiving non-Muslims, faking friendship with non-Muslims, not keeping their word to non-Muslims, lying about their faith to non-Muslims, violating treaties with non-Muslims, tricking non-Muslims into letting their guard down and then slaughtering them, and the reputation early Muslims had for lying.
	  
	  **Fatawa Islamiyah** might also be a good resource. I haven't gone through those in a long time but try vols. 6 & 8.
