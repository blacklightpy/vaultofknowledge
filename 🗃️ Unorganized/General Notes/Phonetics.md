Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds or, in the case of sign languages, the equivalent aspects of [[sign]]. Linguists who specialize in studying the physical properties of speech are phoneticians.

It is divided into three branches:
- Articulatory Phonetics (how humans plan and produce speech)
- Acoustic Phonetics (the properties of such produced speech)
- Auditory Phonetics (how humans perceive speech)
# Phonological Units
- Phone: The minimal unit of phonetics, which refers to a speech sound in a language
- Phoneme: An abstract categorization of phones, of the smallest unit that discerns meaning between sounds

Traditionally, the minimal linguistic unit of phonetics is the **phone**—a speech sound in a language which differs from the phonological unit of **phoneme**; the phoneme is an abstract categorization of phones and it is also defined as the smallest unit that discerns meaning between sounds in any given language.
