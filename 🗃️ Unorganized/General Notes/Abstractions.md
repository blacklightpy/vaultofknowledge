What is an abstract concept? What does it mean to think abstractly?

A system at a specific level of complexity is always at a level of abstraction.

If such a system cannot have some deeper meaning to it, it will be universally at the ground level.

Any method of thinking that automates a specific system is called an abstraction.

> [!WARNING] NOTE
> Before I proceed with abstractions, I must note that our society tends to view higher level things as having more value and lower level things as having lesser value.

> There are several reasons for believing this. One is that they attribute more importance to the dreamy aspects, such as chasing the clouds, or a heaven beyond the ordinary life, and hate the ordinary life as dull or as a test. The existence of religions further reinforce this belief on grounds of morality.

> Secondly, whatever is mundane is seen as boring, and that is the lifestyle of lazy people who are of no good to society, except consuming the resources of it. Meanwhile, abstract things such as technologies or a luxurious lifestyle is seen as something that is obtained by hard work, and thus is more superior.

# Examples
## Example 1: Electronic and Electric Circuits
- Consider objects like a resistor, transistor, capacitor, wires, etc. to be at the base level.
	- Of course, it will have deeper implementation details, but for a layman, these are the basic components. Let's just stick with it.
- A circuit board created with that would be a higher level product. That is, an assembled circuit board is composed of elements at a lower level of implementation, i.e. the basic components.
	- EDIT: Add "abstract design" and "specific circuit". But will this come before or after this? Or should I rewrite the whole thing?
	- I guess the answer to that depends on whether we are thinking from a "user's perspective" (in which case it goes from science -> components -> design -> circuit -> build -> firmware -> kernel -> OS -> mechanical design -> CX), or from a "designer's perspective" (in which case it goes from idea -> CX -> mechanical design -> OS -> kernel -> firmware -> build -> circuit -> design -> components -> science)
		- There's a catch. Your knowledge of a lower lever of abstraction helps you make the higher levels. For example, your knowledge of science gives you access to more components, and even unknown components. Your knowledge of components help you make a good design. And your access to a proper design helps you define a circuit that implements it. Then your knowledge of CX practices shape your idea itself.
		- It is possible to start with a higher level of abstraction and find a way to implement it. This mode of designing requires will power, and is meant for visionaries.
		- Businessmen and Consumers who want to get a job done would start at a lower level of abstraction and build up the possibilities. They prefer to use whatever's tried and tested to make an easy living.
- Now, if the circuit is electronic, it could sometimes be driven by a firmware software. Since the behaviour of the system is dependent on the firmware, the firmware can be said to be at a higher level of abstraction.
## Example 2: Mathematics
## Example 3: Operating Systems
(I probably meant "operating" "system")
## Example 4: Politics
(I probably meant governance at separate levels; plus add the different aspects of governance)
