A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.

A system, surrounded and influenced by its [[environment]], is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and is expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory and other systems sciences.
