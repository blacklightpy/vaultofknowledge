In common language, it is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.

In [[criminal law]], the definition is not the same everywhere.

A common definition is that a crime or criminal offence is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to a community, society or the state (i.e. a "public wrong").

e.g. Murder, Rape, Theft

Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (actus reus) must, with certain exceptions (strict liability), be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (mens rea).
