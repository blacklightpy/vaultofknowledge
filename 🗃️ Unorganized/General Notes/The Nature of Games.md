Most games have many different possibilities, that it is unrealistic to learn all possible moves. Only a player like Commander Data could win a really complex game with full accuracy (he could even predict how dies would land).

However, it is possible to become a better player by figuring out the ideal moves in a game.


And that is in regards to games. However, when it comes to religion, we are not really trying to play in many different combinations, but rather, are trying to figure out which moves are problematic, and what should be the counter-moves.
