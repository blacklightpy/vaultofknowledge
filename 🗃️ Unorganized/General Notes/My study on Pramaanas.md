I'll start with no understanding.

Firstly, I'll have to trust what I see and hear from my senses: **Pratyaksha**
Then I'll have to understand how things behave to know how they interact: **Anumaana**
Then I'll have to understand the other aspects of life from my guardians and others: **Shabda**
Then I'll have to seek the right understanding of reality for myself: **Para Vidya**
