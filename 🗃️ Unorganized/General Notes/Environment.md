In science and engineering, a system is the part of the universe that is being studied, while the environment is the remainder of the universe that lies outside the boundaries of the system. It is also known as the surroundings or neighborhood, and in thermodynamics, as the reservoir.

Depending on the type of system, it may interact with the environment by exchanging [[mass]], [[energy]] (including heat and work), linear momentum, angular momentum, electric charge, or other conserved properties
