This is from the curriculum of Semester 3 from Knowledge International University (KIU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
# Part 1
> "People who reject Hadeeth are those who lack knowledge in Hadeeth"
> "If Allaah have not blessed this ummmah with any science except Usool al Hadeeth, then this will be sufficient as a proof for Islaam"

Subhanallaah, these are some of the amazing quotes regarding study of Usool al Hadeeth. Usool al Hadeeth, without a doubt, is a science came to protect this deen. After all they say "No one’s life history has been protected like that of the Prophet (sallalahualayhi wasallaam)" Alhamdulillaah, the credit goes again to Usool al Hadeeth.

In studying this noble science with [KIU](http://www.kiu.org/website), I made some notes taking from the classes of Shaykh Shafiq Flynn (Hafidhahullaah). I am posting here in two parts:

## Course Objective
- To familiarize the student with the proofs for the authority Hadeeth and its relationship to Quran
- To acquaint the student with the historical influences in the development of Hadeeth criticism
- To give the student a clear framework for understanding the nature of the methods and the processes of the Muhadithun
- To familiarize students with the methodology for dealing with apparently contradictory evidence
- To acquaint the student with the present culmination of earlier initiatives through textual readings of the books of Hadeeth

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Usool al Hadeeth

A. Definition of **Usool al Hadeeth**:

- a. **Asl**: Foundation on which something is built
- b. **Hadeeth**: words, actions, taqreer, Sifat of Muhammad
- c. **Usool al Hadeeth** is the science investigates foundation upon which hadeeth rest upon which includes chain of narrators, text and so on

B. Objectives:

- a. To present introductory information so that student can understand Hadeeth discourse
- b. To give general knowledge about different components of sciences of Hadeeth

C. Definition of Hadeeth:

E. Is Sunnah and Hadeeth are Synonymous?

- a. Sunnah and Hadeeth are synonymous in the perspective that it is attributed to Muhammad (SAW)
- b. Sunnah actually means physical application/Implementation of Sharee’ah
- c. This is because Prophet said "alaikum bi sunnathi wa sunnathi khulafa rashideena, mahdeena, mimba’deena" and which includes Sunnah of Khulafa Rashideen

F. Authority of Sunnah

- a. Qur’aan 4:64
- b. Qur’aan 53:3,4
- d. Qur’aan 4:59
- e. Qur’aan 3:31
- f. Qur’aan 72:23
- g. Hadeeth has never been a controversial source of Islaam
- h. Hadeeth and Qur’aan never contradict each other as both are from same sources

G. Hadeeth Complements Qur’aan – Functions of Hadeeth

- a. Hadeeth confirms Qur’aan
	- i. Hadeeth on pillars of Islaam which confirms 2:184
- b. Hadeeth explains Qur’aan
	- i. Hadeeth of how to pray explains 2:83
- c. Hadeeth shows exceptions of the Qur’aan

	- iii. This function is stimuli for Muhadeethun to get into the field of Usool al Hadeeth
## Chapter 2: History of Recording of Hadeeth

A. Introductory Comment:

- a. Nothing happens in Isolation in Historical perspective
- b. History of hadeeth recording started with History of Message of Islaam as definition of Hadeeth tells us that sayings/actions/approval/physical characteristics of Muhammad (s)

B. 62:2 – Was all the Arabs unlettered ones?

- a. Qur’aan was preserved in text form by Sahaabah’s
- b. Battle of Badr – Ransom is teaching
- c. Treaty of Hudhaybiah was documented
- d. This tells us that preservation is not only in memory but also documented

C. Why hadeeth was not recorded in the first stage of Islaam?

- a. Initial Ban on documenting – Fearing people will mess-up with Qur’aan
	- i. Prophet: "Do not write anything other than the Qur’aan. Teach my hadeeth verbally. Whosoever fabricates over me will have his seat reserved in hell fire" (Sahih Muslim)
- b. Ban lifted – When recording of Qur’aan was established
	- i. Trap the knowledge. Write it down
- c. Wisdom behind Initial Ban:
	- i. Qur’aan is not accused of being contaminated with Hadeeth
	- ii. Sahaabah’s focused lot on Qur’aan because of this
	- iii. As Sunnah is more of explanation of Qur’aan, one need to focus on Qur’aan first

D. Early Written Records:

- a. Abullaah ibn Amr ibn al Aaas recorded "Do I have to write even when you are angry?"
- b. Abdullah ibn Saeed ibn al Aas
- c. Saad ibn Ubadah al ansaree
- d. Jabir ibn Abdullaah
- e. Abdullaah ibn Abbas
- f. Saheefa ibn Saadiqa recorded during the time of Prophet

E. System and attitude towards Recording

- a. Time of Khulafa Rashideen – Order to write remained absent
	- i. Abu Bakr – He never accepted Hadeeth without witness
	- ii. Umar ibn al khattab – He never sanctioned Hadeeth recording in books fearing it will undermine the Qur’aan and he feared our religion will become the religion of others where Prophet’s words were mixed up. He spent one month of Istikhaara on this.
- b. Time of Tabieen and Tabe Tabieen:
	- i. Many of the Scholars refrained from documenting, sticking with the traditional approach of Oral transmissions but some Scholars documented
	- ii. Caliph Umar ibn Abdul Azeez first officially commissioned written recording of the Hadeeth
	- iii. It was not his personal opinion but resolve of his discussion with Scholars
	- iv. He ordered Scholar in Madeenah, Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Hazm
	- v. Scholar of Hijaz, Ibn Shihaab az Zuhri also requested by the Caliph
	- vi. After that, Ibn Shurayj, Ibn Ishaaq, Malik ibn Anas, Sufyan ath Thaure, Al Awzae, Abdullaah ibn Mubarak, Layth ibn Saad become forerunner in Hadeeth literature
	- vii. These Scholars never focused on other conditions of Saheeh rather Ittisal as sanad alone
	- viii. Their works are called Musannaf

F. Early Hadeeth Literature

- a. Mussanid (Name of the narrator) work started and compiled by
	- i. Ahmad
	- ii. Abdullah ibn Abassi
	- iii. Albasari
	- iv. Al umuwi
- b. Sihah work started
	- i. Muhammad ibn Ismael al Bukhaaree
	- ii. Muslim
	- iii. Ibn Majah
	- iv. Abu Dawood
	- v. Tirimithee
	- vi. An Nasaee
	- vii. These books were compiled based on conditions and fiqh based
- c. Tangent – When the contamination Started?
	- i. During this time, People fabricated Hadeeth, mixed up the language, defended their sects with forged hadeeth
	- ii. e.g. Khawaarij developed political views and supported it with their own invented hadeeth
	- iii. This is the time Ilm Ar-Rijaal and Jarh wa ta’deel started

G. Features of Hadeeth enquiry at that time

- a. They travelled for collecting Hadeeth
- b. Wider network formed because of exchange of hadeeth among the narrators and Scholars
## Chapter 3: Historical Outlook at development of Usool

A. Role of the travelers of Hadeeth

- a. Ar Rahala (Travelers)
	- i. Came to protect the Hadeeth of the Prophet
	- ii. They received the hadeeth first hand from the Source
	- iii. They were dedicated travelers who sacrificed a lot for Ahadeeth
	- iv. Titles given to venerate these travellers: Raheela watayyeb, Expansive in travel, Rahaal
- b. Traders in Hadeeth:
	- i. Kind of travelers who traded in the hadeeth. They would charge particular fee for narrating the hadeeth though they narrate the truth
	- ii. Imam Ahmad criticized this kind of travelers and deemed impermissible to take hadeeth from these people
	- iii. Some criticized that they may fabricate as they are doing it for money

B. Commencement of developing Procedures to protect the Hadeeth

- a. Khateeb al Baghdadee started defining some
- b. Critical consciousness of quality of the person narrating hadeeth developed (**Ilm Jarh wa ta’deel**)
- c. Consciousness of connection of chain developed
- d. Travelling increased the standardization of hadeeth terminologies as it made all parts like one class

C. Role of Public Institutions

- a. In the 6th Century AH, Darul Hadeeth was established by Zinqi in Damascus. Ibn Ashakir was the Teacher
- b. Al Madrasa al Kamiliyah in 622 AH
- c. **Al Ashraqiyah** in 626 by Imam an Nawawee in Damascus
- d. They were the traditionalists of the society and some were accused of going against of Orthodoxy because of corruption caused by Bayt al Hikmah
- e. Titles given by these institutions:
	- i. **Al Musnid** – He will be able to narrate hadeeth with Isnaad
	- ii. **Al Muhadeeth** – Understands the isnaad, realize Pseudo people, identify people, listened to Kutub Sittah, Mu’jam at tabaranee, Musnad Ahmad
	- iii. **Al Haafidh** – One who memorized 100s and 1000s of Hadeeth, knowledge of Science of Men, Knowledge of conditions
		- 1. Ibn Ubdah – Haafidh of Kufa (d. 382 H) who memorized 400000 hadeeth
		- 2. Imam Bukharee memorized 300000 hadeeth

D. How conditions of transmission of Hadeeth developed?

- a. Way of Memorization of Hadeeth:
- Scholars differed over how hadeeth needs to be memorized – Wording and meaning or meaning alone?
	- i. In wording and meaning:
		- Scholars memorized the actual wording of the text from their Shaykh in conformation with Albarra ibn Yazeed’s hadeeth – Prophet correcting him for "nabeeyuka" when he said "Rasoolika"
		- Wording memorization will avoid common mistakes of words
		- Interchanging of words
		- **Lahn** (Incorrect pronunciation)
		- Safety provision added: **Aw kama Qaal**
	- ii. Meaning alone is sufficient:
		- They allowed Hadeeth to be narrated in meaning provided their language is sound, just and other conditions
		- Imam Malik: All those hadeeth that is Marfu should be narrated in Lafdh (same wording). Mauquf Hadeeth (from Sahaabah and others) can be narrated in meaning
		- Ibn Salah: Narration of meaning of the hadeeth is fine in both Marfu and Mauquf . He justified that primary concern among the Sahaabah was its meaning
	- iii. Memorizing the Summary of the Hadeeth
		- Portion of the Hadeeth and not the complete text.
		- Imam Bukharee did this in his Saheeh when having similar narration from other root
- b. Written form communication:
	- i. Once the Student become known to the Shaykh, Shaykh allowed them to relay to others by means of written forms
	- ii. Reached to many by Students
	- iii. It reached to the level of Books
## Chapter 4: Transmission of Hadeeth

A. Tahammul al Hadeeth:

- a. the way in which Hadeeth has been received
- b. Two components:
	- i. Al Adaah – How it was delivered to Shaykh
	- ii. Tahammum – How it was received from the students

B. 8 Popular forms: (range in strength and vary in forms)

- a. Assima (heard)/Samaa’: Reading by the teacher
	- i. Four formats:
		- Recitation from memory by the teacher
		- Reading from books (his book/books of students compiled from his works)
		- Question and answers: Student narrating part of the hadeeth and the teacher completes it
		- Dictation: Sahaabee Waathilah ibn Asqaa was the first one. Az Zuhree used this method
	- ii. Forms: Hadathna/Hadathnee/thanaa/naa – he told to us/he told me
		- Communicated verbally and heard by students
		- Very strong form
	- iii. Akhbaranaa/Aranaa/ana – he told me of some news
		- Synonymous with Hadathna but commonly refers to method of Ard
	- iv. They say Samee’tu and the above forms (eg.: Samee’tu hadathna)
- b. ‘Ard/Alqir’aa (Student read a hadeeth infront of Shaykh)
	- i. Read from written document
	- ii. Read from memory
		- Condition is shaykh should have already memorized the hadeeth
	- iii. After reading use the word samee’tu
	- iv. Student will first copy Shaykh’s material and draw a circle at the end of every hadeeth. Once he reads back to the Shaykh, he will mark the circle
	- v. If he transmits without verification, he is called Saariq al Hadeeth (Thief of Hadeeth)
	- vi. Similar to copyright law- you can buy as many books but not allowed to make one
		- Both the above tahammum form will include entire isnaad. Following forms miss this characteristic
- c. Ijaaza (Permission to transmit)
	- i. Shaykh permits his student to narrate the hadeeth he heard/some of his works without having student read the books back to him
	- ii. "I have committed you to narrate of mine"
	- iii. Student did not directly hear the hadeeth from the shaykh
	- iv. It involves lot of trust upon the students by the Shaykh
	- v. If the book is unknown or shaykh who permitted is unknown, then this form of Ijaaza is unacceptable
	- vi. Form: Anba’na, naba’nee – He called our attention to
		- Muhadeeth were cautious to accept this kind of hadeeth because this is the way of Mudallees
		- Mudallees is one who perform tadlees al isnaad (Confusion in the chain) and tadless ash shuyookh (confusion by the name of the shaykh)
		- Mudallees is not fabrication as the person is not intending to fabricate rather wants to strengthen his hadeeth
- d. Al Munaawalah (Granting books):
	- i. Shaykh gives his verified written document/books to narrate regardless of student is aware, permitting them to narrate
	- ii. Three formats:
		- Al Mun’awala al Ijaaza (Permission in form of document) It is higher form
		- Student prepares the document, Shaykh reviews and permits to narrate it. It is lower form
		- Student prepares book and Shaykh allows to permit that particular book without reviewing the book
	- iii. Eg.: Az Zuhree granted books to Thawree, Al-Awzaa’ee and ubaydullah ibn umar
	- iv. Form: Anba’na, naba’nee
- e. Al Mukataba/ Kitaabah (Correspondence) :
	- i. Shaykh writes a book and send them to the students and allowing them to narrate it
	- ii. Form: Person wrote to me/wrote to us
	- iii. Ibn Abbas wrote to Ibn Abee Mulyakah and Najdah
- f. Al I’laam (Announcement):
	- i. Student/Teacher announces he has the permission to narrate the particular text provided he has the original copy signed by the author to do so
	- ii. Shaykh goes through with his students and tell them that these are my hadeeth
	- iii. No explicit form of permission
	- iv. Shaykh may mention here it is forbidden for you to narrate this book then that should not be narrated
	- v. A’lamna Shaykh, A’lamna Fu;aan
- g. Al Wassiyah (Bequest of Books):
	- i. Shaykh on his death bed allows his student to narrate particular hadeeth or some of his works
	- ii. Eg.: Abdullaah ibn zayd al Basree (d.104) given wasiyah to Ayoob
- h. Ar Rijaala/Wajaadah (Discovery of Books) :
	- i. When person finds a written document and finds not the author but he attributes it to some shaykh by means of handwriting/others
	- ii. Waja’tu al Fulaan
	- iii. Similar to our case – We read from published Bukharee and we have not met the Shaykh but certain it is book of Imam Bukharee

C. Benefits:

- a. From this shima, one can identity the certainty of the hadeeth and derive ahkam respectively
- b. Demonstrates historical evolution
- c. Practical significance

## Chapter 6: Conditions for acceptability of Rawi (Narrator)

A. Four Conditions for Legitimacy of the narrator:

- a. Aql (intellectual ability/discernment)
	- i. Ability to discern right and wrong and ability to perform the functions of Hadeeth like Al ada’ (deliver) and Tahammul (receive)
	- ii. Based on this they considered age for narration of hadeeth. Scholars have differed in identifying the age required to deliver hadeeth (al-Ada’) and receive it (al-tahammul)
		- People of Basrah allowed age of 10
		- Kufa allowed age of 20
		- Shaam allowed age of 30
- b. Dabt (accuracy)
	- i. Two factors:
		- Amudahara – Person who has strong ability of memory and observation
		- One another way by which rawi becomes Dabt is acceptability of him by other Muhadeeth
- c. Al Adaalah (Honesty/Justice)
	- i. Religious
	- ii. It is not a single moment/act rather continuous assessment
	- iii. Established by Testimonial
	- iv. Established by Witnesses
- d. Al Islaam (Spiritual capability)

B. Historical outlook:

- a. In early stages, these 4 conditions were the practical understanding of the environment as the science was at its infancy
- b. Later Scholars formalized the conditions and categorized

C. What is Jarh wa ta’deel?

- a. Jarh means criticism
- b. Ta’deel means praising
- c. Jarh of sectarian group will not be accepted (eg.:Asharites rejecting the Rawi from Ahlus sunnah wal jamah)

D. Conditions of Jarh

E. Conditions of Jarh attached to Adaalah (Honesty)

- a. Accusation of fabrication
- b. Fasiq (Open transgresson)
- c. Jahalah – when conditions of Rawi is not clear
- d. Bid’at – person guilty of doing Bid’ah
- e. Muroo’ah – He does things that creates doubt about his personal conduct

F. Conditions of Jarh attached to Dabt (accuracy)

- a. Soo’ul Hifz: Bad Memorization (confuses between the text) -this riwayah or equal to more than his Saheeh riwayah
- b. Prone to make mistakes in memory (names, dates, text, etc)
- c. Extreme Carelessness: Person is not smart (Alghaffalah/Katharul Ghaflat)
- d. Al wahm: Person dreams/imagines things
- e. Mukhalafat at thiqah: Report a hadeeth that contradicts the hadeeth of thiqah (Strongly reliable)

G. How to deal with conflicting reports?

- a. Somebody done Jarh (Criticism) and somebody done ta’deel (praise)
- b. We acknowledge/reject based on reasons provided
- c. Person unknown is called Mubham
- d. About those whom we don’t know, we see there is no report that threatens their Adaalah.. We don’t know about his bad conduct and we don’t know about his good conduct as well so we don’t accept until something is established

H. Levels of Jarh wa ta’deel

- i. Person might be a outright liar – completely rejected
- ii. Person forgets sometimes/dreams –
- iii. Person doesn’t act upon what he knows
## Chapter 7: Classifications of Hadeeth terminologies (Ilm Mustalah al Hadeeth)

A. Introduction

- a. Categorized according to different requirements as Hadeeth are of different types
- b. Ibn Salah mentions around 65 classifications in his book Usool al Hadeeth and states these are sciences by itself

B. Ranges of authenticity:

- a. Authenticity ranges between Saheeh and Da’eef
	- i. Saheeh
		- Al hasan
	- ii. Da’eef

C. Saheeh Hadeeth

- a. Conditions:
	- i. Hadeeth al musnad (continuous links of narrator) reaches Muhammad that marfu, mauquf, and not mursal, munqati
		- Muttasil means continuous chain but not necessary that links back to Prophet whereas musnad reaches Muhammad
	- ii. Not a hadeeth which is Shadhdh (hadeeth contradicts hadeeth established by thiqaa)
	- iii. Not a hadeeth which is Mu’allal (no hidden/subtle defects)
		- It may be in the text
		- It may be in chain
	- iv. Communicated by alaadil (Honesty)
	- v. Communicated by Daabit (accuracy)
- b. Saheeh hadeeth can be Ahad or Mutawattir
	- i. In general, hadeeth mutawattir means that group of people that it is impossible to conspire a lie
	- ii. Minimum number of reporters for hadeeth to be Mutawattir
		- Certain number of people at the beginning, middle and the end of the chain will make Hadeeth Mutawattir
		- Some scholars said 4 (based on Qur’aan 24:13)
		- Some said 5
		- Some said 10 because in arabic anything meets 10 is called Jamah
		- Some said it is 12 based on Qur’aan 5:11
		- Some said it is 20 based on Qur’aan 8:
	- iii. Tawattur can happen by two ways:
		- Tawattur bil lafdh -Text (quote unquote)
			- i. Example: "whoever fabricates a hadeeth can expect a seat from the hell fire" [Bukharee]
			- ii. Narrated by 40 Sahaabah’s and among them were 10 promised Jannah
		- Tawattur al Ma’naa – Meaning (found in several supporting hadeeth)
			- i. Du’aa that indicates prophet raised his hand in du’aa
			- ii. "Actions are but by intentions"
		- iv. Ahad
			- Individual narrations
			- Joke: Ahad is like a Muslim and Mutawattir is Muhsin or Mu’min :)
- c. Saheeh hadeeth can be Mashhoor (well known) as well as ghareeb (strange)
	- i. In the chain, there is only thiqaa
	- ii. In hadeeth mashhoor, chain consists of number of thiqqq
- d. Region of origination:
	- One another way to know hadeeth saheeh is from the region of origination of hadeeth (eg. Hadeeth from madeenah is more to be saheeh as Madeenah was free from political/sectarian schism)
- e. Grades of Hadeeth (Imam Nawawi’s Hierarchy of strength within Saheeh) :
	- i. According to conditions of Imam Bukharee, and Imam Muslim (muttaqun alayh) and recorded by them both

## Chapter 11: Treatment of Hadeeth by Fiqhi Schools 

A. Wahy 

- a. Qur’aan 
	- i. contains all Usool ad deen 
	- ii. general maxims 
	- iii. Comprehensive guide 
- b. Hadeeth 
	- i. Contributes to Qur’aan with explanation of Muhammad Sallaalahualayhiwasallam 
	- ii. Consists two major aspects: Official and mundane 
		- One which provides Ahkam (Tashree) and other is part of his daily life 
		- Fuqaha and Usooli Scholars are interested in Tashree aspect of Hadeeth 
		- Usooli – interested in legal maxims 
		- Fuqaha – interested in hadeeth that demonstrates practical implementation of law 
- c. Hadeeth is authoritative but different in constitution from Qur’aan i.e., miraculous nature, 

B. Hanafi Math-hab: 

- a. Founded by Nu’man ibn Thaabith who born in Kufa 
- b. It is School of Ar-Rai (Opinion) 
- c. Imam Abu Haneefa first educated in Aqlaniyaat before Fiqh and Hadeeth 
- d. In many cases, they prefer Qiyaas, Istishaan over Hadeeth that is not being very strong or suitable for legislative purpose 
- e. Kufa and Hadeeth 
	- i. Limited availability of Hadeeth in Kufa 
	- ii. Fabrication of Hadeeth 
	- iii. Persians who accepted hadeeth but not very convinced 
- f. Abu Haneefa’s conditions in accepting Hadeeth: 
	- i. Should be narrated by Jama’ah 
		- He doesnot accept Hadeeth Ahad 
	- ii. Hadeeth should be Mashhoor (generally known) 
	- iii. Hadeeth should be used by other Scholars 
	- iv. If one Sahaabah narrates, it should be heard by other Sahaabah’s and they should not have opposed it 

C. Maliki Math-hab: 

- a. Imam Malik ibn Anas was a Madeenite Scholar 
- b. It is School of Ahlul Hadeeth 
- c. He’s from centre of Hadeeth learning 
- d. Hadeeth and Madeenah: 
	- i. Freely available 
	- ii. High number of Scholars 
- e. Silent Hadeeth: Amal Ahlul Madeenah 
	- i. Inhabitants of Madeenah are inhabitant’s of Prophet’s city and they modeled their life according to Prophet’s conduct

	- ii. Technical: Attaching hukm to the situation which is not textually recorded 
	- iii. Example: Drugs haram because it is something like Alcohol 
- b. Conditions: 
	- i. Asl: there should be textual reference to Qur’aan or sunnah or Ijma 
	- ii. Far: It must be a new situation 
	- iii. Illaa: follows the same line of reasoning of the original hukm 
	- iv. There must be hukm like halal, haram for the Asl 
- c. Criticism: 
	- i. We are applying our own reason and logic 
	- ii. Response: 
		- If our qiyaas is not made on Qur’aan and Sunnah, then argument is valid 
		- We are working within the framework of Qur’aan and Sunnah 
		- Process of Qiyaas will make subtle haram more apparent. It is not creation of Hukm rather systematic tool to make subtleties clear 
- d. Hadeeth played a important role in ruling based on Qiyaas 

### Various approach in using Ahad and Mursal Hadeeth 

A. Ahad Hadeeth 

- a. Sahaabahs unanimously agreed to its usage 
- b. Examples from Major Sahaabah’s 
	- i. Abu Bakr: 
		- "Prophets should be buried where they died" 
		- Report of Mugheera was used to rule that grand mother’s share is 1/6th of inheritance. He asked who can support Mugheera’s statement? Muhammad ibn maslama given a witness 
	- ii. Umar ibn al Khattab: 
		- Taking Jizya from Majus based on hadeeth narrated by Abdur Rahman ibn Auf that they should be treated as like Ahlul Kitab 
		- Aboo moosa al Asharee leaving Umar’s home after knocking three times. Umar asking Aboo Moosa should find someone to support this else he will be dealt. Abu Saeed Sudan witnessed 
	- iii. Uthman: Widow to continue her iddah though her husband was deceased 
	- iv. Hadeeth of Aisha on Ghusl for two private part touching each other even without ejaculation 

B. Exceptions where Ahad rejected 

- a. Narrator is not a Thiqa 
	- i. Umar rejecting Fatima bint Qays case because he did not trust her 
- b. Hadeeth is against stronger evidence 
	- i. Aisha rejected the Ahad hadeeth from Ibn Umar hadeeth on wailing that it will affect the dead on the account that no one will carry sin of other person 

C. Imam Shaafi’ee’s response 

- a. For the argument, Qur’aan says witness as one male and two females. He responded principle is to take witness if they don’t have any mistakes 
- b. Prophet asked us to memorize, preach the Hadeeth 
- c. During time of Prophet, Sahaabah’s shared Ahad hadeeth and the Prophet was silent (eg.: Changing of Kabah) 
- d. Prophet sending 12 messengers to 12 kings (Ahad) 
- e. Sahaabah’s enacted upon hadeeth which were singular 

D. Treatment of Ahad hadeeth by various Schools 
- a. Hanafi – Stringent 
	- i. Rawi should not contradict the reliable reports (eg. Abu Hurayrah washing 3 times for najis of dog when the known position is 7 times with one time being with dirt) 
	- ii. It should not be about serious matter as those will be narrated by tawattur due to needs 
- b. Maliki: 
	- i. It should not contradict Amal-e-Madeenah 
- c. Shafi’ee: 
	- i. Narrator should be Thiqa 
	- ii. He should be aware of what he is narrating (Lafdh) 
	- iii. It should have precession – Dabt 
	- iv. Should not contradict to other authentic Hadeeth 
- d. Hanbali 
	- i. They have no conditions except it should be authentic 

E. Mursal 

- a. Tabi’ee narrates directly from Prophet omitting sahabee who is intermediary between tabi’ee and prophet ie without sahabee name 
- b. Mursal of Sahaabah will be accepted – Jamhoor opinion 
- c. Shafi’ee: 
	- i. It should be from Senior Tabiee 
	- ii. Supported by hadeeth which is Musnad 
	- iii. Mursal should be accepted by other Scholars 
	- iv. Mursal can be strengthened by people of Knowledge 
- d. Hukm: accepted as an authority but still remains as a weaker authority compared with Ahaadi hadeeth which are musnad i.e., hadeeth of complete chain of narrators. 

## Chapter 12: Ilm Naasikh wal Mansookhi (Abrogation and Abrogated in Hadeeth) 

A. Definition of Naskh: 

- a. Linguistic Meaning: 
	- i. Remove/get away (22:52) 
	- ii. To Transfer/Copy (45:29) 
- b. Technical Meaning: 
	- i. It is to remove legal injunction by legal evidence that comes later (after the original Hukm) 
	- ii. Exceptions: 
		- It is not merely any legal text rather Hukm 
		- It is not Takhsees (Specification) 
		- One who can abrogate is Allaah and not anyone 
	- iii. Example: 
		- Abrogation of Hadeeth recording in writing after fear is removed that Qur’aan will mix with the hadeeth 

B. Condition of Abrogating text: 

- a. Abrogating evidence should be kitab shar’ee (Evidence from Qur’aan and Sunnah) and not Qiyaas 
- b. Abrogation must be by text of equal strength 
	- i. Qur’aan abrogated by Qur’aan 
	- ii. Hadeeth Mutawattir can be abrogated by Mutawattir and not ahaad hadeeth 
- c. It should take place after the original text 
- d. What is being lifted should be legal injunction 
- e. Legal injunction should be practical injunction and cannot be legal maxims or matters of Aqeedah 
- f. Abrogated Hukm should not be a permanent hukm or temporary hukm 
- g. There must be apparent contradiction between Naasikh and Mansookh 

C. Something that sounds like Naskh but not: 

- a. Takhsees 

| S.No | Takshees                                                  | Naskh                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Takhsees specifies some part of earlier hukm              | Naskh completely abrogates earlier text |
| 2    | Takshsees can take place by Daleel Aql (logical evidence) | Naskh take place by Naql                |
| 3    | Takhsees not necessarily need to be a later Hukm          | Naskh must be a later Hukm              |
| 4    | Takhsees gives explanation of earlier text                | Naskh does away with the earlier text   |
- b. Taqyeed (Restriction) 
	- i. No conflict with original text 
	- ii. Can happen initial or later 
	- iii. It will not do away with original Hukm rather just restricts 
- c. Bad’aa 
	- i. Making something apparent (39:47) 
	- ii. New opinion is presented when there is no initial idea (12:35 – knowledge of something which was not once there) 
	- iii. It is known according to circumstance 
	- iv. It is to do away with the text 
	- v. Bad’aa comes from created being whereas Naskh comes from Allaah alone as it undermines Allaah of perfect Knowledge 

D. Manifestation in Hadeeth Science 

- a. Mutawattir abrogated by Mutawattir 
- b. Mutawattir abrogated by Ahad 
- c. Ahad abrogated by Ahad 
	- i. Exists mainly here 
- d. Ahad abrogated by Mutawattir 

E. Ways to identify Naskh in Hadeeth 

- a. Explicit mention of Prophet 
	- i. "I forbade you to visit graves and now you can visit now…" 
- b. Indication by Sahaabah 
	- i. Explicit 
		- Jabir said "last of deeds of Prophet whether to take wudoo from water changed by…" 
	- ii. Fails to explain which text is Naskh 
		- Opinion 1: Sahaabah may be practicing Ijtihaad and not an authority by itself 
		- Opinion 2: Naskh happens only Naql so Sahaabah cannot make their own Naskh 
		- Opinion 3: It is acceptable when there is some supporting evidence that conflicts with the Mansookh 
## Chapter 13: Ilm at-Ta’aarud waTarjeeh (Conflict and Preference)

A. Declaration: Two sound hadeeth will not contradict each other as both are from Allaah 

B. T’a’aarud or Alman’aa (Prevention/conflict) 

- a. Muhadeeth call it as Mukhtaliful Hadeeth 
- b. Defintion: 
	- i. Linguistic Meaning: Stems from the word "Ikhtilaaf" which means disagreement (6:141) 
	- ii. Technical Meaning: 
		- Two prophetic hadeeth that conflict in a way that prohibits each of others implication and meaning 
		- They are not Maqtu or Mursal 
	- c. Number of terminologies developed in this science 
	- d. Mukhtalaf will happen only in authentic reports (Saheeh, hasan, ahad, Musnad) 

C. Two kinds of Conflict 

D. Ways to resolve Conflict: 

- a. Jam (Combining two conflicting hadeeth) 
- b. Tarjeeh (Preferring one hadeeth over another) 
- c. Naskh (One hadeeth would have abrogated another) 

E. Usage of Mukhtaliful Hadeeth 

- a. Ibn Hajar used to mean only for Jam 
- b. Imam Shafi’ee does not include Naskh 

F. Mushkalul Hadeeth (Confusion in Hadeeth) 

- Happens in sound texts 

| S.No. | Mukhtalif al Hadeeth            | Mushkalul Hadeeth                                                        |

G. Qualities of Taa’rud 

- a. Tadaad : opposite 
- b. Authority: Of same authority 

H. Ta’aarud al Haqeeqe (Real conflict) doesn’t take place in Qur’aan & Sunnah (Jamhoor) 

- a. Sunnah is nothing but Wahy (53:3,4 | 21:45) 
- b. If it is from other than Allaah, you would have found contradictions (4:72) 
- c. Takleef: Man cannot do two opposite orders at the same time 
- d. It implies ignorance of Allaah. Subhanallaah 
- e. Why do we have Naskh and Tarjeeh? These Tools indicate that real conflict will never take place 

I. Reasons why conflict appears: (Imam Shafi’ee) 

- a. Regarding Narrator: 
	- i. Lack of Memorization: Narrator asks question to Prophet but he memorize answer alone. (eg.: Hadeeth of Ubaadah ibn Samit. Prohibited sale of something for its value) 
	- ii. Question of Adaa: How narrator delivers hadeeth (Hadeeth on engagement. Engage somebody already engaged and about permission) 
- b. Ignorance of Language and its usages 
	- i. Knowledge of Aam and Khaas is important 
	- ii. Eg.: "From a Muslim, his fellow Muslim’s honor and blood are protected." It seems conflicting with the hadeeth "Neighbour is not permitted to stop his neighbour to plant trees in his property" First one is general and second one is specific 
	- iii. Eg.: "Whoever changes religion, person should be put to death". In another hadeeth, Prophet prohibited killing of women. Here it is Tahsees (Particularization) 
- c. Ignorance of Naskh 
- d. Ignorance about changes in circumstances and environment 

J. How to deal with Ta’aarud? (Order of Approach) 

- a. Jamhoor (All Madh-hab and portion of Ahnaf) 
	- i. Jam 
	- ii. Tarjeeh 
	- iii. Naskh 
	- iv. Tawaquf (Stop and leave it as they are) 
	- v. Choose one over another – Dangerous as it may imply naskh by us 
	- vi. Al Baraa al Asliyah (Going to permission first: Origin of everything is permissible) – Dangerous as we may make something haram as halal 
- b. Hanafee 
	- i. Naskh 
	- ii. Tarjeeh 
	- iii. At Tasakut (Leave both of the hadeeth rather search for other hadeeth) 
		- In terms of tawaquf, we stop and don’t search for other text 
	- iv. Search for Asl 
	- v. Jam (Combination of various hadeeth) 
		- Strange: Jam helps in respecting both authorities so this should be the preference 
		- Hanfee claim Sahaabahs engaged in Tarjeeh first before others 

K. Conclusions: 

- a. These conflicts are apparent and not real. 
- b. Apparent conflict appears mostly due to lack of skill 
## Chapter 14: Tarjeeh Discourse (Ways of Preference)

## Appendix B: Sciences of Hadeeth as critical apparatus in preserving Hadeeth 

- "If Allaah have not given any science to this Ummah except Uloom al Hadeeth, it is sufficient as a proof for Islaam" 
- Islaam is the religion which is blessed with number of sciences. Among it, Uloom al Hadeeth has different branches of sciences which preserves the Hadeeth of the Prophet for more than 1400 years and will preserve it till the day of Judgement. 

- Though Uloom al hadeeth is rich with ample amount of sciences , it can be categorized as follows 

A. Broader Sciences: 

- a. Any Hadeeth is comprised basically of two components 
	- i. Isnaad (Chain) 
	- ii. Matn (Text) 
- b. The science which deals with Chains and scrutinize it from different angles with different tools to confirm its origin is called Ilmud Diraayah 
- c. The Science which studies reality/original text of the hadeeth from different dimensions to give practical implication in our life is called Ilmur Riwayah 
- d. There are certain sciences which absorbs both the above mentioned sciences in giving different benefits such as Ta’aarud wa tarjeeh which deals with chain and text in terms of preference when there is apparent conflict 
- e. Now let us see how each science played a role of critical apparatus 

B. Ilmud Diraayah (Testing the Chain) 

- a. Ilm Tahammul al Hadeeth (Process of Transmission) 
	- i. This Science with very precise wordings such as Haddathna, Akhbarna indicates to the reader how the hadeeth was received or transmitted 
	- ii. Further this science indicates certainty which helps in deriving ahkam in addition to the demonstration of Historical evolution of that particular hadeeth 
- b. Ilm Rijaal al Hadeeth/Asmaa ar Rijaal (History of the narrator) 
	- i. In the due course of transmission process, there developed an science Asmaa ar Rijaal, which captured the historical background of the one who narrates the hadeeth from birth to death, character to manners and so on to the effect of history of the Rawi (narrator). 
	- ii. This helped in protecting the credibility of authentic chains of the hadeeth 
- c. Ilm Jarh wa ta’deel (Condition of the narrator) 
	- i. With the help of knowledge from Rijaal al Hadeeth, Jarh wa ta’deel helped in scrutinizing the chain from the perspective of the narrator whether he is the praised one (ta’deel) or he is dispraised (Jarh) 
	- ii. This dictates conditions of the narrator 
	- iii. Oldest name of this science is Naqd al Hadeeth 
- d. Ilm Mustalah al Hadeeth (Principles of Hadeeth) 
	- i. This is really a usool of Hadeeth which gives the comprehensive information about Hadeeth with the help of terminologies 
	- ii. This Science clarifies the following 
		- From where the hadeeth is originated? eg.: Qudsi, Marfu 
		- How good the link between the levels (Tabaqat)? eg.: Musnad, Mursal 
		- How many narrators involved in the transmission? eg.: Mutawattir, Ahad 
		- What is the nature of the text and the Isnaad? eg.: Musnad, Mudraj 
		- What is the reliability level and memory of the narrator? eg.: Sahih, Da’eef 
	- iii. Greatest benefit of this science is that it gives us the Hukm of the hadeeth whether we have to accept or reject 

C. Ilmur Riwayah (Testing the Text) 

- a. Ilm Mukhtalifal Hadeeth (Handling Conflict) 
	- i. After Hadeeth is confirmed with the help of sciences of Riwayah that it is truly the hadeeth from the Prophet, then focus is turned to text of the hadeeth 
	- ii. Mukhtalifal Hadeeth informs us how one should handle when there is apparent conflict between two authentic hadeeth 
	- iii. Tools this Science provides for resolution are as follows: 
		- 1. Can we combine two hadeeth? – Jam 
		- 2. If not, Can we prefer one hadeeth over the other? – Tarjeeh 
		- 3. If not, Check whether any of the hadeeth was abrogated? – Naskh 
	- iv. This Science helps saves us from the greatest sin of rejection of Hadeeth and derives benefit of the hadeeth 
- b. Ilm Ghareeb al Hadeeth (Strange words are no more strange) 
	- i. This science helps one to understand the strange words in the hadeeth and helps in studying the hadeeth from linguistic dimension for proper understanding 
- c. Ilm Naasikh wa Mansookhi 
	- i. This science helps in deriving the legislation of the hadeeth and demonstrates how hadeeth also followed Qur’aans gradual way of legislation and bringing/abrogating law based on needs and necessities 
	- ii. This informs us which hadeeth abrogates which hadeeth and so on 
- d. Fiqh al Hadeeth (Ruling from the Hadeeth) 
	- i. This science tries to compile all the hadeeth that are relevant for Fiqh rulings such as the books of Abu Yusuf, Abu Dawood, A’laam al-Muwaqqi’een of Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah and others 
	- ii. This science ultimately gives the fruit of the hadeeth 

D. Both Diraayah and Riwayah 

After studying the Isnaad and text from different dimensions, there are certain sciences which studies in combination of text and chain and gives us numerous benefits 

- a. Ilm Ilal Hadeeth (Microscopic Lens) 
	- i. This science helps in finding any subtle defects either in Isnaad or in the text. 
	- ii. Challenging study which requires sound knowledge of different sciences of hadeeth and specialists like Imam Muslim, Abu Dawood and later scholars like Shaykh Albanee are known for it 
- b. Ilm al Ta’aarud wa tarjeeh (Conflict and Preference) 
	- i. When there is apparent conflict, this science helps in determining which hadeeth can be preferred over the other by means of following preferences 
		- Tarjeeh in Isnaad according to Rawi and strength of the chain 
		- Tarjeeh in the text according to language, meaning and implication 
		- Whether Tarjeeh can be determined from the external sources 
- c. Ilm Takhreej al Hadeeth (Retrieval Process) 
	- i. This science helps in retrieving the hadeeth and gives one stop information about the hadeeth such as 
		- Where this hadeeth can be found? 
		- Condition of the Rawi 
		- Hukm of the hadeeth 
		- Related hadeeth and versions 
		- Supporting hadeeth and so on 

E. Conclusion

Thus the above sciences tests/critically analyses the hadeeth from the perspective of components of the hadeeth producing authoritative results and establishes hadeeth as the credible source for knowledge and implementation. All this scrutiny has been employed not only to ascertain the originality of the revelation but also eases the way for most part of Islaamic Sciences such as Fiqh which highly depends on Uloom al Hadeeth.
