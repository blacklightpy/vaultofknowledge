Suicide bombing may be a sin, but killing infidels and dying isn’t.

In **5:32**, he was referring to the command that was given to B’nei Yisra’El. In the next verse, **5:33** he says that the punishment for them, since they did not follow the Torah (according to Mohammed), their punishment had to be brutal in this world too:

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

**Tafseer Ibn Katheer**

> (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that **t****hey shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land.**) **`Wage war' mentioned here means, oppose and contradict, and it includes disbelief, blocking roads and spreading fear in the fairways. Mischief in the land refers to various types of evil.** Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that the Ayat,

**Tafseer Ibn Katheer:**

> (And kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law).) This part of the Ayah emphasizes this prohibition in specific, although it is included in the immoral sins committed openly and in secret.

> In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,

> «لَا يَحِلُّ دَمُ امْرِىءٍ مُسْلِمٍ يَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنِّي رَسُولُ اللهِ، إِلَّا بِإِحْدَى ثَلَاثٍ: الثَّيِّبُ الزَّانِي، وَالنَّفْسُ بِالنَّفْسِ، وَالتَّارِكُ لِدِينِهِ الْمُفَارِقُ لِلْجَمَاعَة»

> (The **blood of a Muslim person** who testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is prohibited, except for three offenses: a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse, life for life, and whoever reverts from the religion and abandons the Jama`ah (the community of faithful believers).)

See what it says, only the blood of Muslim people.

> There is a prohibition, a warning and a threat against killing the Mu`ahid, i.e., non-Muslims who have a treaty of peace with Muslims

Who are the Mu’aahid? It only includes the Dhimmah, and the Mushrikeen who come to Daar Al-Islaam to learn about Islaam. But after they learn, they won’t later have a second chance to keep treaty. Because as per many Hadeeths (**Jami at-Tirmidhi 3092**, **Jami at-Tirmidhi 3092**, and many others are in Arabic and in Siyaar (Biographies)), the treaties always have to be fixed term, and are only to be considered a ceasefire, because Jihad al-Talab is necessary worldwide. As for indefinite term treaties, they can be broken anytime, according to Surah At-Tawbah / Al-Bara’ah Ayah 1 (9:1). Also see its Tafseer by Ibn Katheer.

> Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,
> 
> «مَنْ قَتَلَ مُعَاهِدًا لَمْ يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا لَيُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًّا»
> 
> (Whoever killed a person having a treaty of protection with Muslims, shall not smell the scent of Paradise, though its scent is perceived from a distance of forty years. )

Wow great. That ought to deter people from accidentally slaughtering Kuffar.

**2:256** only means that there is no point in forcing someone to become Muslim without, because they will not gain Jannah. But it is not a prohibition against killing those who don’t want to convert.

**Tafseer Ibn Katheer**

> (There is no compulsion in religion), meaning, "Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam."

Muslims have noble intentions in this regard, but are stupid, and think all other people are evil and so should be killed. And also, this came before Surah At-Tawbah (Repentance) / Al-Bara’ah (Freedom from Obligations), which is the last Surah.

**8:61** was revealed is abrogated by **9:5** and **9:29**, and is only valid when Muslims are not strong enough to take them on. It is shown by the other contradicting verse of **47:35**:

**47:35**

> **“So be not weak and ask not for peace (from the enemies of Islam) while you are having the upper hand.** Allaah is with you, and He will never decrease the reward of your good deeds’

**Tafseer Ibn Katheer**

> (So do not lose heart and beg for peace while you are superior.) meaning, in the condition of your superiority over your enemy. If, on the other hand, the disbelievers are considered more powerful and numerous than the Muslims, then the Imam (general commander) may decide to hold a treaty if he judges that it entails a benefit for the Muslims. This is like what Allah's Messenger ﷺ did when the disbelievers obstructed him from entering Makkah and offered him treaty in which all fighting would stop between them for ten years.

This means that 8:61 only applied in the special context, when Mohammed was trying to go to Mecca for the first Hajj, and encountered the Quraysh, and he couldn’t fend them off at the time.

Also see **Tafseer al-Qurtubi** on **8:61:**

> واختلف العلماء في حكمها، فقيل: إنها ناسخة لقوله تعالى:" وإن جنحوا للسلم فاجنح لها" «٢» [الأنفال: ٦١]، لأن الله تعالى منع من الميل إلى الصلح إذا لم يكن بالمسلمين حاجة إلى الصلح. وقيل: منسوخة بقوله تعالى:" وإن جنحوا للسلم فاجنح لها". وقيل: هي محكمة. والآيتان نزلتا في وقتين مختلفي الحال. وقيل: إن قوله" وإن جنحوا للسلم فاجنح لها" مخصوص في قوم بأعيانهم، والأخرى عامة. فلا يجوز مهادنة الكفار إلا عند الضرورة، وذلك إذا عجزنا عن مقاومتهم لضعف المسلمين.

**Google Translate:**

> The scholars differed in their ruling, saying: It is an unwritten statement: "And the people of heaven were blessed with peace." If there was no peace then only Muslims needed peace. And he said: Canceled words: "And the world will rest in peace." He said: This is the court. And this visit comes at different times. And he said: These sayings, "And the world is blessed with peace", are specific to the people who are unaware of them and others in general. **Therefore, it is not permissible to make sacrifices except when absolutely necessary, that is, if we are unable to resist the weakness of the Muslims.**

Also, see that **8:61** flows straight into Surah At-Tawbah / Al-Bara’ah, starting with the Ayah with the Bara’ah (Discharge from Obligations) (**9:1**).

> ˹This is˺ a discharge from all obligations,1 by Allah and His Messenger, to the polytheists you ˹believers˺ have entered into treaties with:

The context of the revelation is mentioned in the following Saheeh Ahdeeths (listed in the Arabic Reference Scheme).

(Basically Mohammed decided to break all peace treaties, because one party allied with Muslims attacked another party allied with Quraysh (Mohammed knew earlier that the two clans were always fighting each other - so he just exploited the right opportunity because he observed (as anyone can) that the Arabs are fools without honour or common sense, and therefore can be stirred into revolt because it is logically provable that a treaty was broken). And that was ignoring that Mohammed himself had violated the treaty twice himself (which I’ll show next))

Here’s when Mohammed broke the treaties on his behalf. Luckily for him, Quraysh were humans, and not bloodthirsty like him to start a war and kill and risk people’s lives for small violations.

First, these were the conditions of the treaty:

**Saheeh al-Bukhari 2700**

> On the day of Hudaibiya, the Prophet (ﷺ), the Prophet (ﷺ) made a peace treaty with the Al-Mushrikun on three conditions:  
> 1. The Prophet (ﷺ) **would return to them any person from Al-Mushrikun** (polytheists, idolaters, pagans).  
> 2. Al-Mushrikun pagans would not return any of the Muslims going to them, and  
> 3. The Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions would come to Makkah the following year and would stay there for three days and would enter with their weapons in cases, e.g., swords, arrows, bows, etc.

**This is when Mohammed violated the treaty earlier:**

- Mohammed refused to return the women who emigrated by revealing **60:10**, effectively violating the treaty of al-Hudaibiyya. He said that since the wives have become Muslim, they are not valid for the disbelieving husbands.

- Saheeh al-Bukhari 2711-12
- Saheeh al-Bukhari 2731-2732
- Saheeh al-Bukhari 4180-81,

- Abu Basir started stopping Meccan caravans, killing the passengers and looting them. When they asked Mohammed to send him back in accordance with the treaty, he revealed **48:24–26** to make another exception.

- Saheeh al-Bukhari 2731–2732

And Mohammed later declared war, because when the treaty was declared, from two clans who would fight each other, Banu Khuza’ah joined with the Muslims and Banu Bakr joined with the Quraysh (**Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah - The Life of Muhammad Translated by A. Guillaume p.504**).

**p. 505**

> The apostle's companions had gone out without any doubt of occupying Mecca because of the vision which the apostle had seen, and when they saw the negotiations for peace and a withdrawal going on and what the apostle had taken on himself, they felt depressed almost to the point of death.

> ‘The apostle then went on his way back (from Hudaybiya) and when he was half-way back, the sura al-Fath (Victory) came down: 'We have given you a plain victory that God may forgive you your past sin and the sin which is to come and may complete his favor upon you and guide you on an upright path'’ [Ibn Ishaq, p. 505–06].

When Banu Bakr reportedly later attacked Banu Khuza’ah, for revenge for them killing one of their members in the past, Mohammed sent the Quraysh an enoy asking them to stop supporting Banu Bakr. Some of them told him they don’t care, since Mohammed himself didn’t follow the treaty properly. But then, Quraysh leader Abu Sufyan decided to not make it a problem and renew the treaty. But Mohammed said no and attacked. Mohammed cleverly utilized the treaty to attack Quraysh, exterminate them and steal the holy place that belonged to them for years.
