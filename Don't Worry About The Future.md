Spiritual Traditions have this concept of Astrology, which comes from the idea that the Macrocosm is a reflection of the Microcosm. Now I neither affirm or deny this, but I think it's an okay perspective to have.

But then, the birth based astrology is defined based on the idea that the arrangement of the stars reflect the life of the individual. But then, we notice that there is no direct mapping, as the other conditions such as the place and time of birth are different for each individual. Then astrology believes that since they are similar, we must be able to get a reliable estimate.

But I bring up the condition of the double pendulum, where even if you started with similar initial conditions, the very small deviations will result in very large deviations in outcomes. Now one way to resolve this would be if you keep track of astrology each time. That is, if the conditions of two double pendulums are similar, the deviations will be small for a small duration, after which it starts to rapidly deviate. In that manner, if you rechecked your astrology at some point, you could make another estimate of your short term future. It's in that sense, kind of like a medical checkup.

However, this ultimately is based on theories of what relations imply what, and as far as 'my limited knowledge' goes, I cannot verify it. But I do know that whatever conditions I'm born into have always been outside of me, so it is outside of my responsibility, since I do not control what I'm given, including my mind, by which I make my decisions. Then all I really have to do is accept that what caused me is in control of my path in life, and I can be at peace knowing that.
