I disagree with Buddhism.

In Buddhism, a person is just a collection of psycho-physical aggregates.

So each person born is simply due to the actions of everyone else.

The goal of Buddhism is to end such cycle, by ensuring that we ourselves do not contribute to it, and end our contribution.

However, then I wonder, if the goal is to eliminate our contribution, why would that be a meaningful goal if we cannot get others to reduce it?

Buddhists say that engagement in actions will eventually lead to heightened suffering for all beings, and this will lead them to pursue the path of liberation.

This is similar to the Hindu cosmology in which as time goes on, humanity will tend to be less righteous, and the world sill need to be rebuilt. However, Buddhism coneys the same idea, just without having a God.

However, there are two counters to this theory. The first is the dogmatic assertation that life brings suffering and it leads one to seek liberation. But since that is the basis of this theory, I'll let it be. Iw will ofcus on the more easier area to attack, which is self-consistency.
