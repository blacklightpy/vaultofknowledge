I disagree with Buddhism.

In Buddhism, a person is just a collection of psycho-physical aggregates. So each person born is simply due to the actions of everyone else.

The goal of Buddhism is to end such cycle, by ensuring that we ourselves do not contribute to it, and end our contribution.

However, then I wonder, if the goal is to eliminate our contribution, why would that be a meaningful goal if we cannot get others to reduce it? Buddhists say that engagement in actions will eventually lead to heightened suffering for all beings, and this will lead them to pursue the path of liberation. This is similar to the Hindu cosmology in which as time goes on, humanity will tend to be less righteous, and the world sill need to be rebuilt. However, Buddhism coneys the same idea, just without having a God.

However, there are two counters to this theory. The first is the dogmatic assertion that life brings suffering and it leads one to seek liberation. But since that is the basis of this theory, I'll let it be. I will focus on the more easier area to attack, which is self-consistency. The question is that, if the goal is to extinguish the fruits of action, by suppressing action, then there should be a finite amount of action in the world in order for this process to be meaningful. If so, what is the origin of this finite amoun of action? Secondly, if there is an infinite amount of action, then anyways, regardless of your contribution, new psycho-physical aggregates will definitely come into being through the actions of others.

Secondly, many of the practical stories used by Buddhists are also things that I have disagreements with. There is a story about a monk being sent to a woman who had learned to suppress her thoughts, which gave her the ability to read others' thoughts, while the monk who went there got scared of her, knowing that she could read sexual thoughts about her which the monk had. However, if I was in his place, I wouldnt have felt bad about it, because I didn't choose to have those thoughts. So such suppressions of what's true does not apply to me. Only those who follow a code of ethics that is in conflict with their true naature will find it wrong and feel the need to suppress those thoughts in front of her.
