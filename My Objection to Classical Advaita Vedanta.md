It is that Advaita denies any use to studying Vyavaharika Sathya besides to handling life in it.

That is, by the rope-snake analogy, you are taught that the rope does not have any attributes of the snake, so it does not matter. That is, in empirical reality, even if bad things happen to you, none of that ultimately matters because that is not the ultimate reality.

Yet, a curious mind wishes to both know the ultimate reality as well as the nature of the empirical reality that emerges from it. While Saankhya-Yoga and Nyaaya-Vaisheshika attempted to define this in more detail, Western philosophers and scientists have made progress on this front.

Is Antahkarana the Upaadhi of Maaya?
