The fundamental difference between the right and the left is that the right believes that the world has certain edge conditions, which demarcate good and evil, and therefore "good" is a special mode of the world, where you separate yourselves from "evil", whereas the left believes that "good" is the natural case of the world, and "evil" arises from ego, and therefore "evil" can be dissolved to find a better path.

Now one may wonder, how can it be the right who believes that the world cannot be good, when it is they who believe in the idea of a heaven, while the left believes that the material world is reality? But that is simply how a right wing person sees the left.

In reality, the "heaven" of the right wing is a conception that exists to negate the idea of "peace" existing in the world. That is, they assign the right to grant "heaven" to an unreachable God.

A right winger does not even necessarily believe in the God. They just want other to believe. For example, Jordan Peterson, when asked the question of faith, he simply said "I act as if God exists". He doesn't want to deal with ontology. He just wants to deal with the rigid rules that enable society, and allow him to handle daily life.

You think the American elites believe in God? Well, they want the soldiers to believe in God so they can die defending the country.

Now what separates the category of "theists" from the right wingers is that they do believe in some God. But a theist could also be a left winger, if the theist believes in an optimistic teleology (purpose) to the world. This is especially the case with Eastern religions, as well as some reform denominations of Christianity and Judaism. Not all optimists would be left wingers, because some would believe only their customs would give rise to heaven.
