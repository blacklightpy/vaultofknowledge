Though I use the term Muhammadianity to be respectful, since Muhammadians do not show the same level of respect to Indian religions, I decided to put up a mirror for them to show them how absurd it is.

If people's beliefs can be reduced to their geography, then surely Muhammad's religion can be called Meccaism or Makkaism, or Arabism. They wouldn't like this, would they? In fact, there's two, Makkaism and Madinaism, and Madinaism is what it mostly is. What would we call the both combined? For the lack of a better fitting word, I'll just call them Arabism.
