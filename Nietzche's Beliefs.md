- He thought that the needs of the rich mattered more than that of the poor - because he was all about greatness.
- He viewed most of humanity as industrial waste in the process of creating superhumans.
- His idealized superhumans won't be caring about happiness, but would be hard ascetics.
- They would care about efficiency.
- In Thus Spoke Zarathusthra, he wrote: "Do I strive after happiness? No, I strive after my works!"

- He criticized the dominant form of materialism in his time - atomism.
- He hated metaphysics, since he thought philosophers couldn't decide whether the transcendental reality or the world of appearances is more real.
- He thought that morality and metaphysics were connected.
- He wrote Thus Spoke Zarathusthra because he thought Zarathusthra was the first person to bring up morality - the divide between good and evil.
- He wrote in Ecce Homo: "Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle of good and evil the true wheel in the working of things â€” the translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, first cause, end-in-itself, is his work."
- He uses Zarathusthra to go beyond morality and metaphysics.
