**Should take bath:**

> मैथुनं तु समासेव्य पुंसि योषिति वा द्विजः ।  
> गोयानेऽप्सु दिवा चैव सवासाः स्नानमाचरेत् ॥ १७४ ॥  
> 
> maithunaṃ tu samāsevya puṃsi yoṣiti vā dvijaḥ |  
> goyāne'psu divā caiva savāsāḥ snānamācaret || 174 ||  
> 
> If **a twice-born man commits an unnatural offence with a male**, or has intercourse with a female, in an ox-cart, or in water, or during the day, — he should take a bath along with his clothes. — (174)
> 
> Manu Smriti, Chapter 11, Verse 174 [(from Manu Smrithi with the commentary of Medhatithi from Sanskrit Wisdom Library)](http://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc202068.html)

> [!NOTE]
> The right translation is "if a Dvija commits Maithunam with a male or female" - it is translated by splitting them into "commits an unnatural offence with a male, or has intercours with a female"

**Loss of Caste (Jaathi):**

> ब्राह्मणस्य रुजः कृत्वा घ्रातिरघ्रेयमद्ययोः ।  
> जैह्म्यं च मैथुनं पुंसि जातिभ्रंशकरं स्मृतम् ॥ ६७ ॥  
> 
> brāhmaṇasya rujaḥ kṛtvā ghrātiraghreyamadyayoḥ |  
> jaihmyaṃ ca maithunaṃ puṃsi jātibhraṃśakaraṃ smṛtam || 67 ||  
> 
> Causing pain to a Brāhmaṇa (by a blow), — smelling at things that should not be smelt, or at wine, — cheating — and **sexual intercourse with a man**, — all this is declared to lead to loss of caste (Gatibhramsa). — (67)  
> 
> Manu Smriti, Chapter 11, Verse 67 [(from Manu Smrithi with the commentary of Medhatithi from Sanskrit Wisdom Library)](http://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc201944.html)

**Expiation:**

> By discharging semen into inhuman females except a cow, into a woman in [her] menses, **into others that have no female organs (i.e., a man or a eunuch),** or into water one should perform the penance of Santapanam.
>

About the case of cow, the context in the preceding verse was written (it's just that the penance is different):

> Prajapatya is laid down for holding sexual intercourse with a beast, or with a harlot. By holding intercourse with a cow, one should perform a Chandrayana spoken of by Manu.
>

## From Dharma Soothra

**Depositing semen other than in the vagina or doings so outside her season:**

> One who does not have sex with his wife during her season, and one who has sex with her outside her season, **as also one who deposits his semen in a place other than the vagina ––they all incur the same guilt.**
> 
> **Baudhaayana Dharma Soothra 3.7.2**

> A man who ejaculates his semen in any place other than the vagina becomes equal to a thief, equal to a murderer of a Brahmin.
> 
> **Apasthambha Dharma Soothra 1.19.15**
