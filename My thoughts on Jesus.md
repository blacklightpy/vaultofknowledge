By principles of causality, I have to hold the view that his actions are meaningful.

But I do not believe that the reports by his disciples match what he said. That also means I do not believe in the Holy Spirit, and the idea that belief in him is necessary for salvation.

What I believe is limited to how the knowledge of his actions will give you salvation, as one realizes that the body is not the true self, and the Kingdom of God is within you. When he died while correcting corruption selflessly, he achieved true liberation from his body, unlike others who would've suffered as they identified with the body.

Now this "identification" is a complex topic, and one that's been explored by many religions. It should be studied separately, or as Japanese artist Hasegawa said about Zen, you'll either get it in 3 seconds or 30 years.

### Imagining him as a Jew

In fact, I can see the absurdity of humanity he saw, when I imagine myself in his shoes in those times, where the people cannot comprehend the simple idea of non-duality, of how the creator is the one within each of us.

As for notions of heaven, I disagree with the way it's put. But simply, the heaven is not of the material world, but one of realizing the world that is neither inner or outer, but the one that's causal for both.

But one could argue that Muhammad also made a similar visualization of him arguing as the prophet of God. So anyone could visualize anyone from their own philosophy, and so the truth of what happened is uncertain at an objective level. That is another reason why testimony is not an objectively valid source of knowledge.
