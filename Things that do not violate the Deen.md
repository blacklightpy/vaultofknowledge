Finding faults with Muhammad or Allaah is punishable by death.

But following systems of belief other than the Deen of Muhammad is not problematic. So according to my system of belief which is not Muhammadian, I consider some things that are permitted in the Deen of Muhammad to be not compatible with my system of belief.

Saying so does not mean that I think it is objectively wrong, because I do not believe in objective morality, and none of it is wrong according to the Deen of Muhammad, and is only wrong according to my moral code.

Todo:
(1) I must keep proofs for each of these claims (there are 73 of them)
(2) I must point out that these are my findings based on my study of those sources, and anyone who knows better than me should correct me

I must also split this into (1) things that are "not don't-s" and (2) do-s. For example, if violence was simply not prohibited, it would not be an encouragement to go do it. Now, all things are stated to be not in violation of the Deen, but within this listing, I could point out which ones are simply not forbidden and which ones are encouraged. Also note that the do-s are different according to Maddhabs, so I will list them according to my knowledge of them. The specific categories I will use are (1) Results of what was Instructed and (2) Results of what was not forbidden.

Since saying "do X" does not tell you whether something is advised or mandatory, I will only consider as "mandatory" the things that are said as don't-s. As for teachings, I will consider them as "recommended", since they are recommended beliefs.

## Effective Double Standards

- Men can have sex with any of their slave women, but women cannot have sex with any of their slave men, since intercourse is ownership, and a slave man cannot own a believing woman

## Encouragement of Deception

- Considering war to be deception
- Permitting any lies to be told during war

## Prophet

- Killing anyone who finds a fault with the Prophet

## Exemptions given to the Prophet

- Considering it right for the Prophet to break any term of any treaty without consequence as long as Allaah gives an exemption
- Considering it right for the Prophet to have exemptions from several rules
- Considering it right for the Prophet to cancel the freeing of a slave, and to sell him to someone else
- Considering it right for the Prophet to reveal a verse allowing sex with female slaves when his wife objected to it

## Treatment of women by the Prophet

- Considering it to be realistic that a woman would consent to sex right after all the men in her family and the whole tribe was beheaded and her newly wed husband was tortured and killed for not revealing the location of their treasure
- Considering it to be realistic for a woman who gave herself in for marriage so that her tribe won't be killed to be happy in that marriage

[Concern for me: If I think that it is not realistic, what opinion do I have of the Prophet? After thinking, I say: consenting to the marriage and intercourse was up to her, and coercing one to do so is not forbidden according to Muhammadians, so there is no fault according to the Muhammadian rationale]

## Prophet Contradictions

- Prophet considering that bells are the tools of Satan while also saying that he received revelations like the ringing of a bell
