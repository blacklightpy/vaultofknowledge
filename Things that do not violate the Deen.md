Finding faults with Muhammad or Allaah is punishable by death.

But following systems of belief other than the Deen of Muhammad is not problematic. So according to my system of belief which is not Muhammadian, I consider some things that are permitted in the Deen of Muhammad to be not compatible with my system of belief.

Saying so does not mean that I think it is objectively wrong, because I do not believe in objective morality, and none of it is wrong according to the Deen of Muhammad, and is only wrong according to my moral code.

Todo:
(1) I must keep proofs for each of these claims (there are 73 of them)
(2) I must point out that these are my findings based on my study of those sources, and anyone who knows better than me should correct me

I must also split this into (1) things that are "not don't-s" and (2) do-s. For example, if violence was simply not prohibited, it would not be an encouragement to go do it. Now, all things are stated to be not in violation of the Deen, but within this listing, I could point out which ones are simply not forbidden and which ones are encouraged. Also note that the do-s are different according to Maddhabs, so I will list them according to my knowledge of them. The specific categories I will use are (1) Results of what was Instructed and (2) Results of what was not forbidden.

Since saying "do X" does not tell you whether something is advised or mandatory, I will only consider as "mandatory" the things that are said as don't-s. As for teachings, I will consider them as "recommended", since they are recommended beliefs.

I agree with this statement. Discovery of truth has to be by experience and experience alone. But actually that is where I disagree with Christians - and it is also the principle followed by all Eastern religions - at least the ones I'm aware of. 

For this the analogy is what I stated yesterday.

> Holy Spirit

I'll agree on just one thing here. Your views of the Holy Spirit is that it "convicts one of sin" - and this is only true - according to you - if you believe in Jesus. But some also view that the Holy Spirit "convicts one to repent and turn to Jesus". My view is that the effect is true, but the cause is simply the same as how Jews see Ruach HaKodesh, or the Spirit of God; as well as how the Veda-s, Aagama-s and Thanthra-s of India view Eeshvara

Also, in common psychology, there's the idea of how a person can never kill another person unless they dehumanize the other person somehow. In the military, they are trained to hate terrorists, while in Muhammad's recitation and the reports of his sayings do that for the followers of his Deen.

An analogy: if a person only has knowledge of the set of causes, labelled X, and not other causes, labelled Y - upon seeing a condition K, he will only think that the cause of K could only have been one of the causes in X - even if in reality, it was one of the causes in Y. Now, not all people do this, but many people who are quick to judge will do it. 

Ah - I remember the original analogy. It is from the distilled version of Kautilya Chaanakya's state-crafting manual, Artha Shaasthra (Science of Prosperity), namely Pancha Thantra (Five Treatises). In the Treatise 5: Poorly Considered Actions, there is a story of The Loyal Mongoose. One day, a priest's wife gave birth to a son. On the same day, a female mongoose gave birth to a baby mongoose, and the mother died. Feeling pity, the couple took the baby mongoose, and raised like their son. She served her own breast-milk to both, and bathed them together and put them on oil, and so on. And the mongoose and her son too were fond of each other. But the wife did not trust the mongoose entirely, because she knew the mongoose was ultimately an animal, and it may harm her son some day. So she always kept a watch on him. Then one day she had to fetch some water, and she informed her husband to keep a watch on the mongoose. But the husband being careless went out for alms without telling her to get food. At this time, a snake entered the house and crawled to the child's bed. The mongoose, knowing the snake to be its enemy, and knowing it may harm its brother, it killed the snake and had his mouth and claws bloodied. Now the woman, knowing her husband's carelessness, was anxious and was hurrying backwards. The mongoose was very proud and decided to run with blood on his mouth to his mother, to show her what he did. But when when she saw the excited mongoose, she thought the evil mongoose must have eaten her baby and threw the water pitcher on the mongoose, killing it, and ran to her house. But when she got there, she found the baby sleeping peacefully, while a snake was torn to shreds. Seeing this, she started lamenting, and when her husband came home with food, not knowing whom to blame, she started calling him "Greedy! Greedy!", and said that it was because of his greed for food and not listening to her that she had to kill her son, the mongoose.

Fear is the reason you want to make this hasty conclusion. And it is a fear of something you have inferred by analogy, but analogy applied on experience does not give you the epistemic right to make an objective claim. That is, if you had seen either Eesho or Abba - and it was not in a normal dream - then it is merely a hypothesis, albeit it could be meaningful to you. What you cannot do is claim that you know the infere

## Treatment of Women

### Instructed with Single Choice

- Considering wives as one's property acquired through payment to her father
- Prohibiting a wife from divorcing the husband directly, or requesting a divorce - by Talaq (repudiation) - without what he considers to be a valid reason - unless he gave deferred her the right to do it by herself, by giving her the right to do a Tafwid (delegated repudiation) - either during the marriage contract, or while married [since it was considered that a man would never want to divorce his wife without a reason, and female nature is to want rationality and self-control - as a couple would get bad reputation since a divorce would expose their family secrets to the public]
- Prohibiting a wife from divorcing the husband judicially without providing what the Shareey'ah court considers to be a valid reason - which does not involve dislike of the husband [Exception: Maaliki Maddhab considers the hatred of the husband as a valid reason to request divorce, since such a relationship is harmful; while Hanaafi school prohibits such reasons]

## Effective Double Standards

- Men can have sex with any of their slave women, but women cannot have sex with any of their slave men, since intercourse is ownership, and a slave man cannot own a believing woman

## Encouragement of Deception

- Considering war to be deception
- Permitting any lies to be told during war
- Encouraging Muhammadians to hide the sins of other Muhammadians so their sins will be hidden by Allaah
- Acting according to good and Hadeeths is fine, but others cannot complain about those Hadeeths, since not all Muhammadians follow it
- Weak Hadeeths are used in Da'wah, since it's usage is not forbidden, as they have plausible deniability

## Encouragement of Hostile Attitudes

- Considering that the end of Allah's purpose won't arrive until Jews fight the Muhammadians and they are killed

## Prophet

- Killing anyone who finds a fault with the Prophet

## Exemptions given to the Prophet

- Considering it right for the Prophet to break any term of any treaty without consequence as long as Allaah gives an exemption

- Considering it right for the Prophet to cancel the freeing of a slave, and to sell him to someone else
- Considering it right for the Prophet to reveal a verse allowing sex with female slaves when his wife objected to it

## Treatment of women by the Prophet

- Considering it to be realistic that a woman would consent to sex right after all the men in her family and the whole tribe was beheaded and her newly wed husband was tortured and killed for not revealing the location of their treasure
- Considering it to be realistic for a woman who gave herself in for marriage so that her tribe won't be killed to be happy in that marriage

[Concern for me: If I think that it is not realistic, what opinion do I have of the Prophet? After thinking, I say: consenting to the marriage and intercourse was up to her, and coercing one to do so is not forbidden according to Muhammadians, so there is no fault according to the Muhammadian rationale]

## Prophet Contradictions

- Prophet considering that bells are the tools of Satan while also saying that he received revelations like the ringing of a bell
