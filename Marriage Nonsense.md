There's the "tradwives go for hypergamy" theory, which states women, especially in India marry higher up men. 

Then there's the "incels marry down" to get a woman they can control. My criticism of this is that you often have to be stupid to ever agree to such marriages to get exploited. I feel like often times, women simply get woo-ed by their wealth rather than the personality to fall for them.
