Universe = System + Surroundings.

You are a system, and without you living your destiny, the Universe would not be complete.

That is, even though Advaita claims that you are ultimately Brahman, separate from Maaya, the you within Maaya is equally important.

All that is in Maaya is grounded on Brahman, but it is still real in that sense.

If the point was to end Maaya by realizing Brahman, then it wouldn't have formed in the first place. If Avidya was Anirvachaneeya, then it could pop back up any time, and all effort would be pointless. In that sense, it would be the same as Buddhism, saying all that is Vyavahaarika is meaningless, and one should find peace in realization of non-duality.

Technically, both nothingness and infinity are equally non-dual. Even in ultimate infinity, there is a void-l equilibrium.
