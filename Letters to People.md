Fundamental difference between the right and the left.

Left:

- Anarchy (no authority) is the natural state.
- And it is peace.
- Setting rigid conditions that disturbs this peace causes war.

Right:

- Anarchy (no authority) is the natural state. (Exception: Islam, thinks rule of Allah is the natural state)
- And it is chaos.
- When certain rigid conditions are met, it leads to peace.

Theists say God has commanded them to follow XYZ laws.
Atheists say "Common Sense", defined as the sense of the majority and tradition defines these laws.

On the other hand, the far-left believes in anarchism.
The moderate left believes that people have believed numerous foolish things and have caused large scale wars and exploitation, so one must define what's right purely based on scientific evidence. This leads to materialism.

I'm on the position of the moderate left, while also being someone having spiritual knowledge. I believe materialism can only lead to peace when defined under the framework of non-dualistic spirituality.

**More on Left:**

Far leftists are usually artistically inclined, and lack the scientific rigour of moderate left (and accuse them of being right wingers), or the moral assertiveness of the right. Since even the wild world has principles, and we cannot live safely among tigers, their views never work out in the modern civilization. They are loud and lack discernment, and support Islamists thinking since they seem less rigid, they are better than the West. But little do they know Islam is a strategic religion where they stay silent like a wolf and pounce on you when the opportunity arrives. There are two mindsets when they support Islam. One is fooled by their rhetoric and thinks that they are a religion that emphasizes love, and believes ISIS is Mossad and 9/11 was by the Jews. In my view, they (Muslims) emphasize love, but only in-so-far as you cry as you read the Qur'aan. They love their family, so much that they kill those who leave this "family". The other, knows Islam is bad, but does not know how bad in detail, and foolishly thinks that the Western Christian nationalists can only be countered using Islamists, instead of fighting on their own. I view this as cowardice, in addition to it being grounded on foolishness, because if the Islamists take over, they will lose all they had. Though there are dangerous theocrats in the West, the distribution of problematic people is very less among Christians as compared to Muslims.

The most moderate of the leftists are called liberals. They are of two categories. There are those who believe that, like the right, some principles define co-existence, and unless they are met, there is no co-existence. Then there is the other category whoever performs the most violence is wrong. In my view, the latter are less informed. Some among the first are communists (not socialists, i.e. not authoritarians), and others are capitalists. The ones that are capitalists are called libertarians or anarcho-capitalists. The communists are called anarcho-communists. The other first category tend to be "social democrats".

Between the moderate left and the far left lies the Marxist spectrum. Marxists believe that history is explained through the ways in which people learn to distribute wealth. The wild is anarchic, but as man had intellect, he chose to control property. This began with the change from primitive communism, to slave society, to feudalism (a few own all the resources) to capitalism, and he proposed this will turn into socialism (state owns all the property) and then back to the more educated communism. Vladimir Lenin was the one who first tried to implement this next stage of socialism with the October Revolution, and he believed that until communism happens, there should be a dictatorship of the Communist Party.

Aurora Aksnes is a far leftist (anarchist). I'm an anarcho-communist, but I realize hierarchy is important, as polity is not possible when people are not all equally educated. So I prefer an aristocracy (not oligarchy) as a safe layer to protect the structure of the anarcho-communist polity.
