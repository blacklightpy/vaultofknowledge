He gave an analogy on desirelessness, here: https://prabhupadabooks.com/d.php?qg=1633

> Just like you are dancing here. Actually, bodily, there is some trouble because you are perspiring, but you are not feeling the trouble; you are feeling pleasure. Otherwise how you can dance?

That's a nice analogy for performing service to the Lord. However I disagree with most other parts of his ideas.
