It takes the red crystal analogy. A colourless crystal (non-dual ultimate) appears as red due to the presence of a flower (lack of knowledge). When the flower is removed, the colour disappears.

I asked, where does the flower exist then?

ChatGPT said, the flower does not, it is the perception of the crystal as red that makes you feel a flower exists. Upon seeing the true nature of the crystal as not being coloured, the flower disappears.

But that left something to be answered. Why do we even see the crystal as red, if we are the crystal?

ChatGPT said, Avidya is Anaadi (beginningless, which in Advaita circles mean its origin cannot be traced, but it had some arbitrary beginning), and ends with knowledge. In other words, this can also mean that "beginning" is a concept under causality, which itself exists under this Maaya, while Brahman is eternal.

So when you ask when it began, it's a wrong question, because it is Avidya that causes "beginnings" and "ends" themselves.

The crystal **never actually becomes red**—it only **appears red to an observer** who sees it through a condition (Upādhi).  
🔹 But who is the observer? **Jīva.**

Let me guess. Brahman generates many patterns, kind of like shadows. Some shadows percieve, but they see the reality as made of shadows, because they are only shadows. Brahman doesn't cause shadows, because they just appear due to it's reflective and projective nature.
