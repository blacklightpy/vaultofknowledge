Here, I wish to study what each Darshana (and each Aachaarya - maybe on sub-notes) says.

In Dvaita, there is Pancha Bheda:
- Eeshvara-Jeeva
- Eeshvara-Jada
- Jeeva-Jeeva
- Jeeva-Jada
- Jada-Jada

Is Prabhupada's Achinthya Bheda-Abheda what I saw? No. I did not see a God with a personality. It was me, and it mirrored me from the outside. I was part of it, and I was the whole too. That was my Darshana.

That's unlike Prabhupada who says we are part of the whole, but we are not the whole. 

I think the personality of God is the personality of a cleaned mind. However, we cannot describe it to someone who doesn't have such a mind, so we need to present an ideal personality for them to see. These are the Devathas we've created.

> This body is a creation of God, But God is beyond this body. God is the foundation of all. God is the foundation of this body too. And God isn't transformed. This body is by his illusion. Yet, it is a real and created illusion.

<span style="color:lightblue"><b>I guess this could be my fix of Advaita, that the "illusion" is real and created, not a misapprehension.</b></span>

### Achintya Bheda Abheda:
- Soul is linked with God, but not the same as God.
- Same in Quality, but not Quantity (Opposite of Vishishta Advaita, i.g.)
- God has all opulences, soul only has parts of it.
- Sparks and Flame.
- Sun and Sunshine.

- God has a personal form.
- He exercises control over reality.

> Advaita concept is related to the ontological status of the world, whereas both Svayam Bhagavan and his shaktis (in Lord himself and his powers) are empirically real, and they are different from each other, but at the same time they are the same. Yet, this does not negate the reality of both

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Thākura outlines in detail the famous ten foundational principles found in the teachings of Śri Caitanya Mahāprabhu from Caitanya Caritāmṛta. These are called Daśa-Mūla. He wrote 12 verses to describe it, and the first verse is the Soothra Shloka:

> āmnāyaḥ prāha tattvaṁ; harim iha paramaṁ; sarva-śaktim; rasābdhiṁ;
> tad bhinnāṁsāṁś; ca jīvān prakṛti-kavalitān; tad-vimuktāṁś; ca bhāvāt;
> bhedābedha-prakāśaṁ sakalam api hareḥ; sādhanaṁ śuddha-bhaktiṁ;
> sādhyaṁ tat-prītim; evety upadiśati harau gaura-candro bhaje tam
> 
> 1. The Vedas (āmnāyaḥ) speak ontological truth.
> 2. Hari is supreme.
> 3. He possesses all potencies.
> 4. He is an ocean of rasa (taste, quality, spiritual emotions).
> 5. The jīvas are His separated manifestations.
> 6. Some have been devoured by material nature (due to their taṭasthā (marginal) nature).
> 7. Some are liberated due to their bhāva-bhakti (and are free frommaterial nature).
> 8. Everything is both different and non-different from Hari.
> 9. Pure bhakti is the way of attainment (sadhana).
> 10. Divine love (prīti) is the objective.

**Also from Prabhupada:**

> Where is the question of advaita if Krsna says ‘Surrender to Me’? Our philosophy is both advaita and dvaita. We are one with Krsna in our qualities, but He is much greater than us.”

**Don't fear bombs:**

> **Reporter:** Sir, I . . . mine was a very hypothetical question. Supposing hundred pure saintly Kṛṣṇa conscious people are meditating or discussing or just surviving together, and there comes somebody, some _dushta_ (evil person), who drops a bomb, and at the end of all . . .
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** So those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, they are not afraid of bomb. They are not afraid of bomb.
> **Reporter:** How to face such people? We are such, sir, we are . . .
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** Now they receive bomb then, "It is Kṛṣṇa's desire that bomb has come."
> 
> ...
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is never afraid of anything. _Bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād_ (SB 11.2.37). One who has conception of anything other than Kṛṣṇa, he is afraid. One who knows everything is Kṛṣṇa, why he should be afraid? If bomb is coming, he will see, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is coming." Yes. That is the vision of the devotee. So he thinks, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa wants to kill me as bomb. Oh, that's all right. I will be killed." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Caste:
**
> **Reporter:** With your permission, may I ask one question? Do we completely . . . do we offer any solution for socio-economic problems that . . . (indistinct) . . . can . . .?
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** Yes. Provided you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything will be solved.
> 
> **Reporter:** Will it come by itself, or will it come through you?
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** Immediately. Immediately.
> 
> **Reporter:** How, sir?
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** Huh? That you have to take it.
> 
> **Reporter:** But to completely . . . (indistinct) . . . to follow the . . .
> 
> **Prabhupāda:** Just like Kṛṣṇa says, _cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ_ ([BG 4.13](https://vanisource.org/wiki/BG_4.13_\(1972\) "BG 4.13 (1972)")): "These four _varṇas—Brāhmin_, _Kṣatriya_, _Vaiśya_, _Śūdra_—it is created by Me." But you are trying to kill it. Why? If you try to kill Kṛṣṇa's program, then how you will be happy?
