Here, I wish to study what each Darshana (and each Aachaarya - maybe on sub-notes) says.

In Dvaita, there is Pancha Bheda:
- Eeshvara-Jeeva
- Eeshvara-Jada
- Jeeva-Jeeva
- Jeeva-Jada
- Jada-Jada

Is Prabhupada's Achinthya Bheda-Abheda what I saw? No. I did not see a God with a personality. It was me, and it mirrored me from the outside. I was part of it, and I was the whole too. That was my Darshana.
