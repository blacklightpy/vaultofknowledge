Here, I wish to study what each Darshana (and each Aachaarya - maybe on sub-notes) says.

In Dvaita, there is Pancha Bheda:
- Eeshvara-Jeeva
- Eeshvara-Jada
- Jeeva-Jeeva
- Jeeva-Jada
- Jada-Jada

Is Prabhupada's Achinthya Bheda-Abheda what I saw? No. I did not see a God with a personality. It was me, and it mirrored me from the outside. I was part of it, and I was the whole too. That was my Darshana.

That's unlike Prabhupada who says we are part of the whole, but we are not the whole. 

I think the personality of God is the personality of a cleaned mind. However, we cannot describe it to someone who doesn't have such a mind, so we need to present an ideal personality for them to see. These are the Devathas we've created.

> This body is a creation of God, But God is beyond this body. God is the foundation of all. God is the foundation of this body too. And God isn't transformed. This body is by his illusion. Yet, it is a real and created illusion.

### Achintya Bheda Abheda:
- Soul is linked with God, but not the same as God.
- Same in Quality, but not Quantity (Opposite of Vishishta Advaita, i.g.)
- God has all opulences, soul only has parts of it.
- Sparks and Flame.
- Sun and Sunshine.

- God has a personal form.
- He exercises control over reality.

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Thākura outlines in detail the famous ten foundational principles found in the teachings of Śri Caitanya Mahāprabhu from Caitanya Caritāmṛta. These are called Daśa-Mūla:
