There is apostasy and there is idol worship.

**Source:**
In Judah-ism, this is mandated by the Torah, while in Muhammadianity, this is in the Sunnah, which is referred to in the Qur'aan.

Muslims argue that there is more deniability in their jurisdiction, because it's not in the Qur'aan. <span style="color:#8c90f9">[I say this is invalid, because if an article asks you to refer to consider another article as authoritative, then that article is a part of the original articles with regards to authority.]</span>

Further Muhammadians press on as to whether they consider apostasy dishonorable, to which the Jewish answer is simply that it is impossible, as I stated below.

As per Judah-ism, there is no possibility of apostasy, as Judah-ism isn't a belief system. Regarding idol worshippers, there are no instances in Judah-ism where idol worshippers were killed by the Jews, rather than by G-d. Many kings and Jews were seen to be worshipping idols in the Miqra.
