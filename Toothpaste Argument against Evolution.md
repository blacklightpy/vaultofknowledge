Why doesn't the mouth generate toothpaste, if it was seen evolutionarily that having cleaner teeth allow you to live longer?

Actually I did not make this as an argument against evolution, and it was more of an ontological question. Why did we come to be in a world where only part of what we need and could've been possible naturally is made naturally, while we have to get the rest of it ourselves.
