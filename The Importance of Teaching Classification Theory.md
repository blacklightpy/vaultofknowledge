For example, consider the note [[idealism]].

There, I could say I'll be classifying Indian idealism by listing the philosophies and the philosophers under them (because there are more philosophers per ideology), while in case of German idealism, I'd be listing the philosophers first (because there are fewer philosophers per ideology, and in a sense, more philosophers than ideologies).

So we'll need to state this upfront, so that a person trying to parse the data by reading or by code will be able to know how to do it. Now a person could ask, why do the two sections use different classification schemes?

The answer is of course to be more efficient and reduce the duplication in having to say so-and-so philosopher follows the same idea in case of Indian idealism, or to say so and so ideologies have one philosopher each under it, in case of German or Western idealism.
