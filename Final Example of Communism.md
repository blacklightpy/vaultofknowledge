(And why I think AI should replace workers)

Performing any task requires some amount of work. Of course, there are several different ways of doing a task, depending on how smart you are. Nevertheless, there is an average number of steps required to finish any task. I will consider the unit of measurements to simply be "units".

Now, consider there is a company A. The company produces a product which requires 100 units of work for each product. Consider that there are 5 employees in the company. So each person puts in 20 units of work to produce each product. 

Now, for each product sold, the founder takes 30% of the revenue, while the employees together get 70%. I used the analogy of how app stores and game engines take a cut for using their platforms. So that means, each employee will get 14%. So if the profit is $200, the founder gets $60 and each employee gets $28. I gave the discrete example aside from percentage, because it will become relevant.

Now, consider that a new automation technology emerged, that can do 70 units of work for free. Just consider the work required to maintain the machine as negligible, like friction or air resistance. A real example would be like the machine automates 70 units of work, but requires 10 units for its maintenance, raising the total work to 110 units. But that just makes the math a bit complicated for no big difference. Just like when we add air resistance. It's useful in practice, but not when we are thinking roughly.

So then, if the product's price is not reduced, the profits are still $200.

Now let's not assume the founder is not doing nothing. Initially, let's consider that the founder was doing 10 units of work, or even, 30 units of work, depending on how much capital they had. Nevertheless, being the founder, by the company's structure, they hold authority.

Of course, he won't fire when it's five workers, because it's tightly knit, but when it's a large company, it's easier to lay off entire divisions of workers.

- Production of Machines and their Maintenance costs will require units of work. But the total work is expected to reduce, and that's the whole point of machines.
- What is the minimum number of units required to lead a healthy life? Knowing that, we can set up the baseline, and let other aspects only be luxury.

(The average communist I've encountered is a stupid person. He does not think about the total work required. He only demands that everyone do an equal amount of work for 8 hours, and that it will solve wealth division. He also does not think that the net work required will go down, because he is averse to using AI, because he only sees that companies use AI to lay off workers. Of course, if you do not automate, the work required won't go down. What is required is automation (optimization) and decentralization (equalization). Equalization alone won't solve anything to solve the total work required, and will only distribute the total work on to everyone.

Nobody "wants" to work all their lives. Anyone who says that is a liar, unless they are a workaholic, kind of like a fitness lover. If you force them to work on moral grounds, it will not sustain, and it will revert back to smart people making use of the poor people, i.e. capitalism. What needs to be done is that everyone needs to be offered an incentive.)
