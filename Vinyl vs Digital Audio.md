Since Vinyl records record audio by rotations and digital audio is recorded by sampling, there are some differences in the properties of the recorded sounds.

Since vinyl records record audio by rotations, the rate of rotation determines the temporal resolution. The faster the rate of rotation, detail is distributed across a longer space, making it easy to read from. But the thinness of the stylus and the motive ability of the tonearm determine the ability to read well from a smaller speed recording. 

What temporal resolution means is that the variations between the amplitudes and frequencies in the spectrum over time are distributed at a lower distance at shorter rotational speeds, and lower frequencies tend to have their variations more spread out, while the higher frequencies are more closely packed. This means that a slow recording played on a standard turntable would resolve higher frequencies at a lesser level of detail.

On the other hand, digital audio is recorded by sampling the waveforms according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem to preserve the range of frequencies, and the variations in amplitude are preserved by the sample bit depth. So unlike a vinyl recording, a digital audio recording would not have higher frequencies condensed, but instead, would have them cut off.
