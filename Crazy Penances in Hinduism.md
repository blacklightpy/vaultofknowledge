**Mahabharatha, Shanthi Parva, Section 65 (Chapter 159 in BORI CE):**

> A person who violates his preceptorâ€™s bed is evil in his soul and wicked in his intelligence. He must embrace a blazing Surmi and death will purify him. Or he may himself sever his penis and testicles and holding them in his hands, walk straight in the southwest direction, until he dies and falls down. If he gives up his life for the sake of a Brahmana, he will be purified.
