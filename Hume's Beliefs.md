He saw that inductive reasoning and a belief in causality are not based on reason, but based on habits.

Inductive reasoning refers to methods of reasoning where the conclusion does not have a deductive certainty, but rather, has a degree of probability. This is as opposed to deductive reasoning (such mathematical induction), where the conclusion is certain. For example, inductive reasoning includes how X% in a sample set would map to X% of the whole set.

He believed in (1) empiricism, (2) philosophical skepticism (as opposed to rationalism) and (3) metaphysical naturalism.

As opposed to philosophical rationalists, he said that passion, rather than reason, governs human behaviour. He also said that ethics are based on feelings rather than some moral principle.

He is held to be the first European philosopher to have clearly expounded the "is-ought" problem, which is that one form a normative conclusion of an "ought" (what one should do) directly from an "is" (what is).

His compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. He also denied "argument from design" for God's existence.

Immanuel Kant credited Hume as the inspiration that awakened him from dogmatic slumbers.
