Verse: You have the rights to your actions, but not the fruits of your actions.

- He starts to think from two centers: The center of truth or clarity, and the center of confusion or assumption
- He says from the center of assumption or belief, the believer exists, and that is the proof of his belief
- He says also that the existence of an action is what seems to imply the existence of an actor
- He says that from there, the order of the universe seems to imply the existence of God
- He says this is how the ego sees things
- If the ego sees a car moving on the road, he assumes there is a driver.

My comment: That's not necessarily true, and it's also spooky when you see there's no driver.

- It says that since it can experience the show, then someone must be running the show

My comment: Yeah, but it does not really imply that that agent is separate from you. You can make a game and walk right into it.

- He says this is simply because action is the only way in which the ego proves its existence
- If doer-ship does not exist, then ego has no existence.
- He says action exists, and change is constant.
- So being is becoming.
- In that sense, there seems to be no one who can claim the ownership of the show.
- Neither do we see anyone running the show.
- Then we make two assumptions, and these two assumptions are the root of all human suffering.
- One is the one that's running the larger show, or God, and the other running the smaller show, or ego.
- These are the assumptions we made on the basis of the presupposition of doer-ship to actions.
- We think the moon is attracted to the earth, and that attraction should thus be driven by God.
- We think we are attracted to the girl next door, and that attraction is driven by ourselves.
- In that sense, both God and Ego are defined on the basis of the same assumption, of action.
- For every action, we suppose a causer, like the house needing an owner, or kids needing to be given birth.
- Now, we don't deny the action, and the actions have causes.
- Species are coming in from somewhere, galaxies are behaving the way they do.
- Some species come and go in 5 seconds, others take longer, the animate and the inanimate have life cycles.
- So at the aggregate level, there is God, and at the personal level, there is you.
- You cannot be a believer in God and not be egoistic, and vice versa.
- The logical fallacy here is that one assumes that because there is action, there is an actor.
- This is why if religion is not based on philosophy, its based on superstition.

My commentary: Yes. If you take complete system where each part affects the other (it's not a thermodynamic system, where the universe = system + arbitrary surroundings, but a universe treated as a system), and you take a subsystem from it, the subsystem can observe that the rest of the system (it's surroundings) behave according to some rules, and it is a part of it, and to it, that implies a creator of the system. But then, the subsystem does not realize that the subsystem is an important part of the system, without which the system won't run.

In other sense, the system and the subsystem are co-eternal, although both change. That is, if you remove the subsystem arbitrarily from the system, then the system won't be able to complete its trajectory as it would otherwise. The subsystem's place in a given moment, although it will change the next moment, has effects on the system at all points in time. We cannot call such a subsystem insignificant to the system, and can only see it as non-different from the system.

- So if you ask a believer, he will say that because everything exists, there has to be a causer.
- But this is based on an unverified assumption, that every action has a causer.

My comment: In fact, this is true (i.e. that it does not follow). For example, one can accidentally perform actions, and this does not mean they caused it. They were not even paying any attention to it, and nor would it be their responsibility. Other people want to ascribe responsibility on to them, but that does not make it true. If they had their will, they would not have done it, and that's why it is an accident. In fact, all events that happen do so without will, simply because our desires are not out of our own free will. In the same sense, there is no reason to assume that the ultimate set of actions has a causer. To make such a claim, one would need to use some different reasons.

- In fact, all action is without an actor.
- That is the message of the Bhagavad Geetha.
- That is the message of all spirituality.
- In fact, the moment an actor comes into a self-imposed existence, it condemns itself to suffering.
- Existence is suffering, because existence is false.
- It's like going to an uninvited party. You do no exist, and are not invited. But you want to be there.
- Now the doer is interesting. If you are the doer, you must have control over the results, right?
- In fact, the doer wants to have control over the results, and that is the cause of all suffering.
