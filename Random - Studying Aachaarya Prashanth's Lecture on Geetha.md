Verse: You have the rights to your actions, but not the fruits of your actions.

- He starts to think from two centers: The center of truth or clarity, and the center of confusion or assumption
- He says from the center of assumption or belief, the believer exists, and that is the proof of his belief
- He says also that the existence of an action is what seems to imply the existence of an actor
- He says that from there, the order of the universe seems to imply the existence of God
- He says this is how the ego sees things
- If the ego sees a car moving on the road, he assumes there is a driver.

My comment: That's not necessarily true, and it's also spooky when you see there's no driver.
