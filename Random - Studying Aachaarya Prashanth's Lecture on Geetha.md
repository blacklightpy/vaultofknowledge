Verse: You have the rights to your actions, but not the fruits of your actions.

- He starts to think from two centers: The center of truth or clarity, and the center of confusion or assumption
- He says from the center of assumption or belief, the believer exists, and that is the proof of his belief
- He says also that the existence of an action is what seems to imply the existence of an actor
- He says that from there, the order of the universe seems to imply the existence of God
- He says this is how the ego sees things
- If the ego sees a car moving on the road, he assumes there is a driver.

My comment: That's not necessarily true, and it's also spooky when you see there's no driver.

- It says that since it can experience the show, then someone must be running the show

My comment: Yeah, but it does not really imply that that agent is separate from you. You can make a game and walk right into it.

- He says this is simply because action is the only way in which the ego proves its existence
- If doer-ship does not exist, then ego has no existence.
- He says action exists, and change is constant.
- So being is becoming.
- In that sense, there seems to be no one who can claim the ownership of the show.
- Neither do we see anyone running the show.
- Then we make two assumptions, and these two assumptions are the root of all human suffering.
- One is the one that's running the larger show, or God, and the other running the smaller show, or ego.
- These are the assumptions we made on the basis of the presupposition of doer-ship to actions.
- We think the moon is attracted to the earth, and that attraction should thus be driven by God.
- We think we are attracted to the girl next door, and that attraction is driven by ourselves.
- In that sense, both God and Ego are defined on the basis of the same assumption, of action.
- For every action, we suppose a causer, like the house needing an owner, or kids needing to be given birth.
- Now, we don't deny the action, and the actions have causes.
- Species are coming in from somewhere, galaxies are evolving due to some reason.
