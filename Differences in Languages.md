Here's an excerpt from one of my other notes:

> There is a trend called Sattology (contrast to Mythology, since "Myth" and "Mithya" means unreal, and "Sath" or "Sathya" means real). I guess it's a bad choice of words, because the opposite of "mythos" in Greek is "alethios" (truth) or "logos". So it should've been "alethiology" or "logology", which sounds more natural instead of this poor method of combining Samskritham and Greek. 

Here, Samskritham and Greek are Indo-European languages, and that's why "mythos" and "mithya" are related, since they have the same roots. However, "sat" is not as common in Greek. So even when though the languages are related, when combining a word from one language that's evolved away from another language, the combination of words would feel different. This illustrates that all words in a language have a common phonetic nature.

Now, since the word "myth" is common to both languages, an analogy to "mythology" can be made in Samskritha as "mithyaa-padanam" or "mithyaa-shaasthra", since the analogy for the word "logos" (study) is "padanam" or "shaasthram".
