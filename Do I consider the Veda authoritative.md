The Veda may align completely with my views. Yet, I do not consider it authoritative. In that sense, I cannot be considered Nastika or Astika. Because until I know it, I may be Astika.

But as far as I do not know what it says, I cannot consider it authoritative. Because I do not believe without knowing.

I could be Nastika in the sense that I do not give an infallible authority to the Vedas before reading it. I refuse to hold something authoritative because it is traditional.
