### In Judah-ism

There are references to the Spirit of God.

- Ruach HaKodesh (רוח הקודש): The Holy Spirit

**Word Gender:**

Ruach (Spirit) is a feminine word. It is used alongside Shekinah (Dwelling / Presence, of God). Sakina is also used 6 times in the Qur'aan. In Syriac too, the word Rucha is feminine, and so both the Orthodox and Gnostic Churches use maternal images when speaking of the Holy Spirit. Only in Greek, when the word Parakletos is used is the gender masculine.

**Appearences in the Bible:**



**From Rabeinu Bachye's commentary on Devarim 33:8, 2:**

**ודע** כי ארבע מדרגות הן בנבואה, בת קול אורים ותומים רוח הקדש נבואה, וכלן מדרגות חלוקות זו למעלה מזו וכלן נמשכות מן המדה הנקראת צדק, וזהו (איוב כ״ט:י״ד) צדק לבשתי וילבשני.

There are four distinct levels of prophecy. Bat Kol, Urim veTumim, Ruach haKodesh, and full-fledged prophecy. They are listed here in ascending order, but all of them are derivatives of the emanation tzedek; this is the meaning of Job 29,14: ”I clothed myself in righteousness and it robed me; Justice was my cloak and turban.”
