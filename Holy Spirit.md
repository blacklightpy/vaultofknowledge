### In Judah-ism

There are references to the Spirit of God.

- Ruach HaKodesh (רוח הקודש): Holy Spirit
- Ruach Elohim: Spirit of God

**Word Gender:**

Ruach (Spirit) is a feminine word. It is used alongside Shekinah (Dwelling / Presence, of God). Sakina is also used 6 times in the Qur'aan. In Syriac too, the word Rucha is feminine, and so both the Orthodox and Gnostic Churches use maternal images when speaking of the Holy Spirit. Only in Greek, when the word Parakletos is used is the gender masculine.

**Appearences in the Bible:**

Ruach HaKodesh:

- Chapter 63 of the Isaiah refers twice to "His holy spirit" (ruach kodsho) in successive verses.
- Psalm 51 refers to "Your holy spirit" (ruach kodshecha)
- Psalm 51 also contains a triple parallelism between different types of "spirit":

> Fashion a pure heart for me, O God; create in me a steadfast spirit (רוּחַ נָכֹון‎). Do not cast me out of Your presence, or take Your holy spirit (רוּחַ קָדְשְׁךָ‎) away from me. Let me again rejoice in Your help; let a vigorous spirit (רוּחַ נְדִיבָה‎) sustain me.

Ruach Elohim:

- Genesis 1:2: "a wind from God sweeping over the water" 
- 1 Samuel 16:13: "and the spirit of the LORD gripped David from that day on."
- Psalm 143:10: "Let Your gracious spirit lead me on level ground."
- Isaiah 42:1: "Behold My servant, I will support him, My chosen one, whom My soul desires; I have placed My spirit upon him, he shall promulgate justice to the nations."
- Isaiah 44:3: "So will I pour My spirit on your offspring, My blessing upon your posterity."
- Joel 2:28: "I will pour out My spirit on all flesh; Your sons and daughters shall prophesy."

With the death of the last three prophets (Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi), the Holy Spirit ceased to manifest itself in Israel, and only the [[Bat Kol]] remained available to the sages.

**From Rabeinu Bachye's commentary on Devarim 33:8, 2:**

**ודע** כי ארבע מדרגות הן בנבואה, בת קול אורים ותומים רוח הקדש נבואה, וכלן מדרגות חלוקות זו למעלה מזו וכלן נמשכות מן המדה הנקראת צדק, וזהו (איוב כ״ט:י״ד) צדק לבשתי וילבשני.

There are four distinct levels of prophecy. Bat Kol, Urim veTumim, Ruach haKodesh, and full-fledged prophecy. They are listed here in ascending order, but all of them are derivatives of the emanation tzedek; this is the meaning of Job 29,14: ”I clothed myself in righteousness and it robed me; Justice was my cloak and turban.”
