Religion is an empty word that means nothing. A materialist would say that it refers to anything that is not materialism. But this definition is used by them to "politically" vilify groups of people by an arbitrary label regardless of the fact that all materialists and all non-materialists don't hold the same views. Also, by materialism, one also means that the said material is inert.

Ask instead, "What is your metaphysics?".

Reality is not merely formless (Nirguna). It is only so in its natural state. All phenomena that exists is also a  product of the real substratum. So it also has certain powers to create the world of co-existence.
