I've explained the case of Sathyakaama Jaabaala in [[Implication of Caste for Moksha]].

In case of Vidura, he was blessed

Vyaasa was born to Sathyavathi, who was born to an Apsara and hence had no Varna. He was born from Sathyavathi and Maharishi Parashar. The mother is also involved in deciding the Varna if one is to go by the logic of the Smrithi (the same one that makes this claim, making it self-refuting). (Mahabharata, Amshavatarana Parva, Chapter 63, Gitaprem Press)
