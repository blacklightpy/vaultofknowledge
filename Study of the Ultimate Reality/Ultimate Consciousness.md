In idealism, there is a single ultimate consciousness from which all material and abstract conceptions emerge.

One can come to know about the existence of this ultimate consciousness using the principle of negation of what's not ultimate (Anupaalaabdhi / Abhaava). In Christianity, this process is called Apophatic Theology.
