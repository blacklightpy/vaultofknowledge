I say that I know upon observing someone, despite how good they are today, how they had been bad once.

But then, what about forgiveness? And what about knowing that there is no doer, and all of this is the material world imposing itself on to the soul? How can I judge the soul for being trapped in the material world?

So I will not judge anyone, despite their mistakes. Not just in words (because I've said this and still judged them), so I'm repeating it.
