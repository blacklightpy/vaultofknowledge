I was wondering, why is everything else an "ism", while Christ-ian-ity is an "ity"? The "ian" is for being in Christ, fine, but why is the rest an "ity" instead of an "ism"? It is because they use the style of the language in favour of exalting their religion.

But to keep it neutral, henceforth, I shall use the term Christianism.
