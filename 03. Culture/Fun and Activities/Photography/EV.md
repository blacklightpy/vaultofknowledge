Formula: $EV = \log_2\frac{N^2}{t}$ N = aperture | t = shutter speed 

- Also $\frac{N^2}{t}=\frac{LS}{K}$ , S = ISO | L = Luminance | K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
- The calculators for EV Equivalence used the formula $EV=\log_2{\frac{100N^2}{St}}$ 

> I observed that for my smartphone with fixed aperture (f/1.79) and Shutter Speed and ISO set to Auto, when EV was set to +4.0, the ISO varied from 12799 to ~2000 as light increased, while the shutter speed remained at 1/14, and only changed to 1/20 under very bright light.
> 
> And as I changed the EV to -4.0 and pointed at the sun, the shutter speed was 1/10753 and increased as light decreased, while the ISO remained at 53. Even in total darkness, the shutter speed reached a maximum of 1/33 and ISO reached a maximum of 1489.
>   
> The calculations were not all that perfect, because at EV -4.0 the configuration was 1/25s | ISO1489. But by manually setting the shutter speed to 1/25s at EV -4.0, the ISO was 378. Similarly, manually setting the ISO to 320 or 400 kept the shutter speed at 1/136 or 1/130 respectively.
> 
> For the Ultra Wide Angle Lens (f/2.2), the minimum values for EV +4.0 under bright light was 1/3831s | ISO55 and the maximum value in darkness was 1/14s | ISO4000. The maximum values for EV -4.0 under darkness was 1/33s | ISO539


- Equivalent EV doesn't always result in the same image
	- e.g. Shutter speed can be slower causing water to have a ribbon like effect
	- e.g. Aperture can be adjusted to have a shallow/deeper depth of field (DoF)
