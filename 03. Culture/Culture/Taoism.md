I first heard of this from Alan Watts
Gotta look deeper into what this is about

While Buddhism considers desires are to be eliminated, Taoism considers that desires distract one from finding unity with the material world as it is. Further, Mahayana, Zen and Vajra Yaana consider the ego as non-existent and the material world as an illusion, while Taoism considers the ego as a part of the material world.

Are texts considered revealed? Well, some are, and some are not. 

There are two conceptualizations of the Tao.
- Lord Lao, a manifestation of Daode Tianzun (Deified Laozi)
- Tao (Non-Deified)

So revealed texts are attributed to the deities, while non-revealed texts are inspired. But Taoists know that revealed or otherwise, they have passed through human hands, and texts are not the "one true path" to finding union with the Tao.
