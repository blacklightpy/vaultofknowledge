Zen: Zest, Zip, Zap and Zing, Chapter 13 (Godliness: An Experience of Immediate Joy):

The Last Testament, Vol. I, Chapter 27 (War Is Meaningless):


> **Osho:** Everybody cannot be a Picasso and everybody need not go to Everest – and it would be silly! We have to respect people as they are, without any demands on them.
> 
> **Interviewer:** But you don't either: you attacked Mother Teresa recently.
> 
> **Osho:** I attack Mother Teresa because she is doing so much harm to humanity.
> 
> **Interviewer:** In what way?
> 
> **Osho:** These are the people… Mother Teresa is only symbolic; I call her Mother Teresa the Terrible. These people – Teresa or Pope the Polack or Jesus Christ or Mahatma Gandhi – all these people in a very subtle way… I never suspect their intentions; their intentions may be good, but their actions are dangerous. These are the people who are keeping the world poor.
> 
> Jesus says, “Blessed are the poor.” Now this is something absolutely wrong. The poor are not the blessed, they are the cursed, the condemned. But he consoles them by saying that they are blessed.
> 
> **Interviewer:** But you are selectively using that verse. The full verse is: “Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth.”
> 
> **Osho:** Those who inherit the earth can never be poor, so he was using the word _poor_ purely metaphorically.
> 
> Just wait a minute, just wait a minute. You are quoting wrongly, I was quoting rightly: “Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the kingdom of God,” – not earth.
> 
> **Interviewer:** There are two versions – the King James version says the earth.
> 
> **Osho:** There are not two versions!
> 
> **Interviewer:** The King James version says the earth.
> 
> **Osho:** It is the kingdom of God, basically, in Hebrew. The kingdom of the earth is already possessed by the rich, it is already inherited. Jesus can only promise something in the faraway future, after death. All the religions have been playing that game, of promising people things beyond death. There is no evidence of anything beyond death, whether the poor enter into paradise or the rich enter. It is more probable that the rich will enter.
> 
> There is no possibility for the poor in paradise, if there is no possibility for them here on earth! And these people… Teresa collecting orphans, what is she doing? Creating more poverty in the world. She is against abortion, she is against birth control, she is against the pill: these are sins, naturally. If these things are allowed, orphans will disappear – and with orphans disappearing, who is going to give the Nobel Prize to Mother Teresa?
> 
> I condemned her; she wrote a letter to me. In the letter she said, “I will pray to God to forgive you.” Now the sentence looks perfectly nice, but not to me. It is nasty.
> 
> I wrote back to her, “In the first place I don’t believe in any God, so who are you to pray to a God who does not exist? At least you should have asked me. Secondly, who are you to pray on my behalf? I have not given you the authority. And I have not committed any sin, that God should forgive me. If he meets me, he will have to ask forgiveness from me, because what he has done to the world is enough!”
> 
> All these Tamerlanes, Genghis Khans, Nadirshahs, Alexander the Greats, Ivan the Terribles, Adolf Hitlers, 
> 
> Mussolinis, Joseph Stalins – who is responsible for all these people? Who is responsible for Ethiopia dying? Who is responsible for half the world being poor and on the verge of death? Who is responsible for nuclear weapons?  
> If God is the creator, and if he is omnipotent, omniscient, he knows everything – past, present, future – then he knows that there will be Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And even knowing that, he creates the world? He knows that there will be a nuclear war, and people are piling up nuclear weapons. Even the day he created the world, he knew that one day there would be a nuclear war, and millions of people would suffer tremendous torture and death. “And this is your God,” I told her.  
> 
> She never replied. I again wrote to her, “Reply – because otherwise I am going to sue you in the court. Who can ask for my forgiveness from God, on my behalf, without my permission?”  
> 
> These people are simply trying to increase their numbers. All those orphans become Catholics; all those poor people, aboriginals, become Christians. The hospitals, the schools, the food – these are all strategies. Islam had the strategy of the sword. Christians have the strategy – because the world has changed, ways have changed – they come with bread and butter in one hand and a Bible in the other. Mohammedans used to come with a sword in one hand and the Koran in the other hand. But it is the same – just to purchase you. They are using people’s poverty to make great numbers of Christians, because numbers have power. It is simply politics, nothing else; there is no religion in it. The pope before this Polack who is now the pope, was a homosexual – it was well known all over Italy.  
> 
> **Interviewer:** The earlier pope?  
> 
> **Osho:** Yes, he was a bishop in Milan before becoming the pope, and the whole of Milan knew about it because he was continuously going around with a homosexual, a young man.  
> 
> **Interviewer:** But that's purely a sexual preference.  

That’s what I am saying – that it is perversion, not preference.  

**Interviewer:** Osho,  
You mean a man like you, who believes in free sex, you would object to people exercising a sexual preference?  

No, it is not a preference. Otherwise, soon you will be making love to the camera, making love to the electric pole. And please, don’t disturb my junipers! It is not preference, it is unnatural. This homosexuality is a religious contribution to humanity. It started in the monasteries, where only men were living and no woman was allowed in. It started in the nunneries, where only women were living and no man was allowed. Naturally, man is intelligent enough to find some way.  

All the monks have been either masturbators or homosexuals, but in some way they have to do something. You cannot change their biology by just preaching. Their bodies won’t listen to your Bible.  

**Interviewer:** But you were a celibate at twenty-one. Why can't they be?  

I have never been a celibate.  

**Interviewer:** Your _Bible_ says that.  

I have never been a celibate. If people believe it, that is their foolishness. I have always loved women – and perhaps more women than anybody else. You can see my beard: it has become grey so quickly because I have lived so intensely that I have compressed almost two hundred years into fifty.  

**Interviewer:** Of sexuality?  

Yes. But I am not a homosexual. These people have been talking of celibacy, and creating sexual perversion. And the sexual perversion has led to the disease AIDS, which can kill almost two-thirds of humanity. Who will be responsible for it?  

**Interviewer:** Osho,  
Where do you draw the line between sexual perversion and sexual experimentation?  

There is no sexual experimentation. Sex is a purely biological thing, absolutely determined by biology. For example, in the wild no animal is homosexual. But in a zoo, if only male animals are there and no female is available, they turn into homosexuals. Your world is a zoo, not a wild place. In a wild jungle, nobody… No animal ever turns into a homosexual.  

**Interviewer:** So would you, like Rousseau, talk in terms of going back to nature, to the wild?  

No. I am not saying back to nature, I am saying forward to nature. Not back – back is not my vocabulary – _forward_ to nature. There are tremendous treasures hidden in nature, which these perverted people have denied humanity enjoying. I am against these people, because what they are saying and what they are doing ultimately results in something like a curse.  

All the religions have been preaching celibacy, and nobody has ever bothered whether celibacy is medically possible or not. Even Mahatma Gandhi at the age of seventy was having wet dreams in the night. And you cannot find a more sincere man, trying more sincerely than he tried to be a celibate. For forty years, no success. And do you know, in the end he started sleeping with a naked woman? But Gandhians don’t talk about it.  

Gandhians even approached Mahatma Gandhi, asking him, “Please don’t do it.” Vinoba was one of them, Kalelkar was another; Maulana Azad, Kripalani, all asked him, “Please don’t do this ‘experiment’” – in your language. It was not an “experiment”; it was forty years of failure of celibacy.  

And all these popes… Just two days ago, a Christian minister was jailed for one and a half years because he was abusing small children. That is experimentation. In the pulpit, in the church, he is talking about celibacy, and inside the church he is abusing small children. One of the fathers filed the case, and he got one and a half years in jail. Now many others have come, because they were afraid to say anything against the religious leader, but now he is in jail, many other children have said that he has been doing the same with them.  
But this is not just about one priest I am saying this: all the priests have to do it! We are forcing them to do it. We respect their celibacy, and that respect is a bribe to remain celibate. And their biology does not know about your respectability; their biology has its own laws and it follows its own laws.  
The people who have been consoling the poor are the enemies of the poor. Poverty can be destroyed immediately. All that is needed is that nations should disappear – only then can wars disappear.  
And seventy-five percent of every nation’s income is going into war efforts. America is even pouring eighty percent of its income into nuclear weapons. Now, if the whole world stops this nonsense, what is the need to be poor? We have so much energy, so much money, so much scientific intelligence.  
But it is strange. In England, in Europe, in America too, they are destroying food – and Ethiopia is dying. And soon India will be in the same position. If you see Rajiv Gandhi, tell him that he will be responsible for India’s poverty and people dying there, because he is exporting wheat outside India, and his own people are on the verge of death – half the country. But he wants a nuclear plant. Tell him that this is not a child’s game, and he doesn’t understand anything about humanity. He had better go and become a pilot again, that is his place! He doesn’t understand, and he doesn’t need to be the prime minister of a country which is suffering from poverty – and he is looking to create a nuclear plant! For what?  
Even if India puts every penny into creating nuclear weapons, it will take three hundred years for them to be equal in power to America or the Soviet Union. And do you think that for three hundred years, America and the Soviet Union will be staying where they are? It is stupid, absolutely stupid, for a country like India to think of nuclear weapons, atomic energy.  
But they go on saying to the poor – in India all the Indian religions, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism – all go on saying, “It is your past life’s bad actions, that’s why you are poor.” That’s the reason – because of these religions – that for five thousand years at least, India has never revolted, has suffered all kinds of poverty, slavery, and accepted it. The religious leaders were telling them, “If you rebel or if you do anything against it, you will have to suffer in the future life.”  
Let me tell you one thing: you will be surprised. One of the great Jaina teachers in India is Acharya Tulsi. There is a Jaina sect, Terapanth, and he is the head of that community. Their basic philosophy is that if somebody is dying of thirst, and you have water, don’t give it to him – because he is suffering from his past life’s karmas, and giving him water means interfering into the punishment. He will be punished again soon, he cannot get rid of it – and by interfering, you have committed a crime: now you will suffer also.  
If somebody is drowning, simply go on walking. Let him drown – it is his past life’s actions, and you should not interfere in any way. For example, if you pull that man out of the water and tomorrow he murders somebody, you are also responsible for that murder. You see, the logic is great! If you had not saved that man, the murder would not have happened. So in the next life you will also suffer, because you saved that man and took part in the murder.  
If you teach people for thousands of years that it is your bad actions in past lives which create poverty, you are stopping them from revolting, you are stopping them from doing something to change their situation. You are telling them, “Just accept the situation in which you are.” And that’s how the East has accepted, and remained poor.  
And still you want that I should not speak against these people – Buddha, Mahavira? I have to speak. To me these are far bigger criminals than Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, because those people have done very little harm. Adolf Hitler killed six million Jews, but how many poor people has Mahavira killed? And living in poverty is far more dangerous, is far more of a suffering, than dying in a beautifully, scientifically-managed gas chamber in Germany. Within seconds you are smoke – holy smoke! – rather than suffering for millions of years.
