## In Judah-ism

**Talmud, Seder Nezikin, Bava Metzia 59a:2** (same context as the Oven of Akhnai mentioned in [[Bat Kol]])

> **One who engages in intercourse with a married woman** before witnesses and with forewarning, **his death is by strangulation, but he** still **has a share in the World-to-Come. But one who humiliates another in public has no share in the World-to-Come.** 

This means that sinners also have a part in the World-to-Come as long as their sin is not too grave.
