## In Judah-ism

**Talmud, Seder Nezikin, Bava Metzia 59a:2** (same context as the Oven of Akhnai mentioned in [[Bat Kol]]):

> **One who engages in intercourse with a married woman** before witnesses and with forewarning, **his death is by strangulation, but he** still **has a share in the World-to-Come. But one who humiliates another in public has no share in the World-to-Come.** 

This means that sinners also have a part in the World-to-Come as long as their sin is not too grave.

**Talmud, Seder Nezikin, Sanhedrin 90a:15:**

> **הֲדַרַן עֲלָךְ אֵלּוּ הֵן הַנֶּחְנָקִין**
> 
> מַתְנִי׳ **כׇּל יִשְׂרָאֵל** יֵשׁ לָהֶם חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וְעַמֵּךְ כֻּלָּם צַדִּיקִים לְעוֹלָם יִירְשׁוּ אָרֶץ נֵצֶר מַטָּעַי מַעֲשֵׂה יָדַי לְהִתְפָּאֵר״. וְאֵלּוּ שֶׁאֵין לָהֶם חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא: הָאוֹמֵר אֵין תְּחִיַּית הַמֵּתִים מִן הַתּוֹרָה, וְאֵין תּוֹרָה מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם, וְאֶפִּיקוֹרוֹס.

> **MISHNA:** **All of the Jewish people,** even sinners and those who are liable to be executed with a court-imposed death penalty, **have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever; the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, for My name to be glorified”** (Isaiah 60:21). **And these** are the exceptions, the people **who have no share in the World-to-Come,** even when they fulfilled many mitzvot: **One who says: There is no resurrection of the dead** derived **from the Torah, and** one who says: The **Torah** did **not** originate **from Heaven, and an _epikoros_,** who treats Torah scholars and the Torah that they teach with contempt.
