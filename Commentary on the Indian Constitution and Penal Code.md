I was looking for cheap spa options (i.e. with the intention of finding something that is non-sexual) around Kochi. I remember having looked this up and finding some good options in 2021. But suddenly I saw that a spa named Moksha Ayurvedic Spa was raided by police on the account of "reprehensible activities," implying "sex work."

Now, I'm a person who believes that prostitution is wrong, but not for the reasons a theocrat would think. I think prostitution, being a form of addictive entertainment, is a wrong means for acquisition of capital. But by the same reason, I think prostitution is non-different from the entertainment industry. Yet, people do not seem to have a problem with the entertainment industry in this manner. So from my perspective, they are not in any sense less guilty than those who work in prostitution. In other words, their problem with prostitution is something else, based on historic concepts of morality. My solution to this is to come up with a moral code on my own, which is part of my work on religion and ethics.

However, since that is a religious ethical code, it will require initiation. However, the Indian Constitution and Penal Code (Bhaarateeya Nyaaya Samhitha of 2024) are currently in action. So, to have a strong effect, one needs to make a commentary on these texts directly to reform them. This is the only way to solve the problems of this federal state, without creating an entirely new state on the basis of religion.
