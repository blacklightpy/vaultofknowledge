Muhammad recited this verse when a few Jews asked him this question.

However, this view has never been mainstream Judaism.

But there may be a few sources for this misinterpretation.

1. Gemara compares Ezra to Moses
2. Apocryphal text Ezra 4 states that since Ezra wrote the Torah from scratch after the First Temple was destroyed, he was the Son of God. This text is not part of Jewish canon for the same reason.

In fact, this is one of the proofs that Muhammad was not a Messenger of God, because he would know better to say that Jews believed that.
