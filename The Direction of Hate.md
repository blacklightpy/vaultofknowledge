We know that the technological revolution happened post WW-II, and like with all prior wars, a lot of technology was captured, in this case by the US from Germany.

In these cases, it shows that technological progress is not merely a product of intellect, but also of war. And since technical prowess also determines strength, developers of technology keep their inventions secretive, and this also affects their users. For this reason, a lot of people hate modern technology, citing reasons of addictive algorithms and invasion of privacy and targeted advertising.

However, what I'd like to make clear is this: it is not the technology that you hate, but the manufacturers. The technology is neutral, and it is the hands of those who wield it who make it into what it is.
