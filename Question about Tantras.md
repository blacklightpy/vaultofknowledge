**Question:** Why are Shaiva Tantras called Aagama, and Shaaktha Tantras called Nigama? What is the meaning of some Tantras being Aagama, and others being Nigama? I do not mean in the sense that Aagama is when Shiva tells Shakthi and Nigama is when Shakthi tells Shiva. Those are convenient labels. What does it mean metaphysically, when knowing Shiva is the static witness aspect and Shakthi is the dynamic aspect?

**Answer (after searching):**

I find that Aagama is about Shiva's nature as fixed, while Nigama tells you how to tap into the creative aspect and be part of the creative process.
