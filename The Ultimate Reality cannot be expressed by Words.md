I used to say this prior to learning Vedanta. But I found the idea better expressed in Vichaara Saagara.

It says the "Shakthi Vritti" of no word can express Brahman. But through the combination of the Shakthi Vritti of multiple words, it can negate them until the final meaning is established.

This is sort of like combining two words to form something that is beyond the two words.

- Vaakya: Word
- Vaachya / Shakhya: Meaning of a word
- Lakshya: Indirect Meaning of a word
- Vritthi: Association between a word and its meaning.
	- **Types**
		- Shakthi Vritthi: Direct Meaning ("river" meaning "river")
			- **Types**
				- Yoga Shakthi Vritthi: Meaning is derived by the component ("riverbank" is "river" + "bank")
				- Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi: Meaning is not based on components (the meaning of "house" is not the sum of any words, even in etymology / it stands on its own)
				- Yoga Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi: Meaning is not the sum of its components ("greenhouse" is not "green" + "house", but refers to a house that grows plants)
		- Lakshana Vritthi: Indirect Meaning ("river" in "house is on the river" meaning "river bank")
			- "river" also means "river bank" in this context.
			- **Types**
				- Jahat Lakshana Vritthi: Indirect Meaning does not contain the Direct Meaning at all (when "river" means "riverbank", it does not mean "river" at all, only the "bank")
				- Ajahat Lakshana Vritthi: Indirect Meaning does contain Direct Meaning too (in "all hands on the deck", "hands" implies "bodies", which includes "hands" too)
				- Bhaaga-Thyaaga Lakshana Vritthi: Indirect Meaning contains one aspect of the Direct Meaning, but omits another aspect of it (in "the snake is just a rope", "snake" implies the existent nature of "snake", but not the )
		- Guna Vritthi: Metaphorical Meaning ("lion" meaning "fierce" in "the man is a lion")
			- "lion" never means "fierce", it is a metaphor alone.
		- Vyangya Vritthi: Suggestive or Evocative association in poetry ("water" in "feel the water, in her body")
			- It's an Aurora song lyric. "Water" feels like "tranquility".
- Lakshana: Association between the Sakhya and Lakshya

# 1. Basic Terms

- Word (Vaakya)
- Meaning of a Word (Vaachya / Shakhya)
- Indirect Meaning of a Word (Lakshya)
- Association between a word and its meaning (Vritthi)
- Association between the Direct Meaning and Indirect Meaning (Lakshya)
## 1.1. Types of associations of words and their meanings

They are of 4 types:

- Association of Words and their Metaphorical Meanings (Guna Vritthi)
- Association of Words and their Suggestive or Evocative Meanings (Vyangya Vritthi)

### 1.1.1. Association of words and their direct meanings (Shakthi Vritthi)

e.g. "river" meaning "river"

They are of 3 types:

- Association of a word with its direct meaning when the word has no constituents (Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi)
- Association of a word with its direct meaning which is not based on its constituents (Yoga Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi)

#### 1.1.1.1. Association of a word with its direct meaning which is based on its constituents (Yoga Shakthi Vritthi)

e.g. "Riverbank" is "river" + "bank".

#### 1.1.1.2. Association of a word with its direct meaning when the word has no constituents (Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi)

e.g. "House" is not comprised of any constituents, even etymologically.

### 1.1.4. Associations of words and their suggestive or evocative meanings as used in poetry (Vyangya Vritthi)
