I used to say this prior to learning Vedanta. But I found the idea better expressed in Vichaara Saagara.

It says the "Shakthi Vritti" of no word can express Brahman. But through the combination of the Shakthi Vritti of multiple words, it can negate them until the final meaning is established.

This is sort of like combining two words to form something that is beyond the two words.

- Vaakya: Word
- Vaachya / Shakhya: Meaning of a word
- Lakshya: Indirect Meaning of a word
- Vritthi: Association between a word and its meaning.
	- Shakthi Vritthi: Direct Meaning ("river" meaning "river")
		- Yoga Shakthi Vritthi: Meaning is derived by the component ("riverbank" is "river" + "bank")
		- Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi: Meaning is not based on components (the meaning of "house" is not the sum of any words, even in etymology / it stands on its own)
		- Yoga Roodhi Shakthi Vritthi: Meaning is not the sum of its components ("greenhouse" is not "green" + "house", but refers to a house that grows plants)
	- Lakshana Vritthi: Indirect Meaning ("river" in "house is on the river" meaning "river bank")
		- "river" also means "river bank" in this context.
	- Guna Vritthi: Metaphorical Meaning ("lion" meaning "fierce" in "the man is a lion")
		- "lion" never means "fierce", it is a metaphor alone.
	- Vyangya Vritthi: Suggestive or Evocative association in poetry ("water" in "feel the water, in her body")
		- It's an Aurora song lyric. "Water" feels like "tranquility".
- Lakshana: Association between the Sakhya and Lakshya
