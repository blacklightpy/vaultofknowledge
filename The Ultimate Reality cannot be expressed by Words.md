I used to say this prior to learning Vedanta. But I found the idea better expressed in Vichaara Saagara.

It says the "Shakthi Vritti" of no word can express Brahman. But through the combination of the Shakthi Vritti of multiple words, it can negate them until the final meaning is established.

This is sort of like combining two words to form something that is beyond the two words.
