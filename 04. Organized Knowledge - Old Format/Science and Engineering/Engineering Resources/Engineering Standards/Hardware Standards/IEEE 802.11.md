IEEE 802.11, or 802.11x (not 802.11X) is a set of standards related to Wi-Fi networks.
# Terms
- Service Set Identifier (SSID): A 32 character case-insensitive name for the network
# Evolution
802.11 was developed as a wireless local network alternative to Ethernet.
It was quickly improved by 802.11a and then 802.11b.
The evolutions are named with short letter suffixes (hence 802.11x).
Capitalized suffixes are for recommended practices than for standards. 802.11F and 802.11T were two of them, but both have been cancelled.

The main Wi-Fi standards are:
- 802.11-1997 or 802.11-1999 (Wi-Fi 0)
- 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) <span style="color:lightblue">[802.11a and 802.11b was developed together, but 802.11b was more affordable then]</span>
- 802.11a (Wi-Fi 2)
- 802.11g (Wi-Fi 3)
- 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) <span style="color:lightblue">[This is when we started naming the generations]</span>
- 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
- 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)
- 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8)
