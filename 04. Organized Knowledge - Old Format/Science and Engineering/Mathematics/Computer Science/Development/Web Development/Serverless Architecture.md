Traditionally, we would rent a server from a provider, and we'd run our code on it.

In serverless, we give the provider the code and they'll worry about where the code runs. We have to specify our server requirements and software running on it, but the setting up of servers goes in the behind. We only pay for the hours or even only the resources we use.

Example, we pass an image and the function to resize an image. The provider will process the image and return the result.
