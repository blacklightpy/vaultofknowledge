# School Formula

A = P*(1+R/100)^t, where
CI = P*\[(1+R/100)^t-1\]

P = Principal
R = Rate (in %) per year
t = Time in years

To convert to general formula, just take the rate per period and time in that period

# Banking Formula
This is used since banks generally give out annual CI rates

A = P*(1+R/n)^nt, where

A = Final Amount
P = Principal
R = Rate (in decimal) per year
n = number of compounds per year
t = Time in years
