Kaivalya (Discerning Liberation)

Jeevan Mukti
Vaideha Mukti


Brahma Soothras criticise Saankhya Darshana.

Vairaagya means two things. Etymologically, it means "devoid of attachment" (raaga).
In Samskrita, it means "dispassion".
In Malayalam, it means "grudge" or "hatred".

- Tri Shareera / Traya Deha (Three Bodies)
	- Sthula Shareera (Physical Body) (Lets us experience life)
	- Sookshma Shareera (Subtle Body) (Holds mental impressions through hysteresis of action states)
	- Kaarana Shareera (Causal Body) (this is the one ultimate conscious spirit)

From https://www.prana-sutra.com/post/sthula-sukshma-karana-sharira:
![[Tri Shareera illustration.png]]

- Koshas
	- Kaarana Shareera
		- Ananda Maya Kosha
	- Sookshma Shareera / Linga Shareera
		- Mano Maya Kosha
		- Vijnaana Maya Kosha
	- Sthula Shareera
		- Praana Maya Kosha
		- Anna Maya Kosha

From https://web.archive.org/web/20210120002556/http://sanatanadhara.com/antakarana/ (maybe available live, I'd seen this site myself too):

![[Koshas and Shareeras illustrated.png]]
Manas cannot know Brahmaan. As Brahmaan, you must treat Manas as a pet. Since it forms the Sookshma Shareera, it will determine the state of the Sthula Shareera (Upaadhi, meaning, form), even in rebirths. That is, even when the Sthula Shareera wears out, the Sookshma Shareera may not be ready to dissolve.

Manas always seeks sensory pleasures based on Raaga (likes) and Dvesha (dislikes).

Buddhi tries to provide a learned guess or Sankalpa (hypothesis). Manas may reject it and choose Vikalpa (unreal fantasy), which will lead to going down bad paths.

Buddhi provides Viveka (discerning intellect), which can be used to examine ones Raaga and Dveshas about each Vishaya (subject). This will eventually lead to right understanding and dispassion (Vairaagya). This practice is called Abhyaasa.

Chittha is the pure state of mind, it attains Vritthi (disturbances) through certain actions. They are:
- Pramaanas (facts)
- Viparyaaya (beliefs)
- Vikalpa (chosen fantasies)
- Smrithi (remembrances and subconscious fantasies)
- Nidra (sleep, a "recharging from exhaustion" state)

Good Notes: https://www.dlshq.org/download/mind-its-mysteries-and-control/
Caste: https://www.dlshq.org/messages/caste-problem-in-india/ (Brahmana caste is not Brahmana quality)
(A Brahmana should guide others to the right understanding.)
(If you teach Vedanta to the fisherman, he will say, “I am as good a man as you, I am a fisherman, you are a philosopher, but I have the same God in me, as you have in you.”)

Vyasana means addictions.

Vaasana means impressions, of Karma.
Sangatam means "to struggle".
Garva means "pride", which leads to "Aham Kaara" notion.

Sankhaara is the word for Samskaara in Pali.

**On the validity of Shabda as Pramaana:**
From https://web.archive.org/web/20210120002556/http://sanatanadhara.com/antakarana/:

**One finds whom to trust for Shabda using the Antah Karana Pramaana (The Epistemologic Source of Inner Faculties), with honesty. This leads one to the Gurus, Rishis, and Parents, and any Avataars of that era.**

The link cites the source for this reasoning as the answer given by Yudhisthira to a Yaksha when he was asked about how one would find the right path when scriptures have contradictions. I had a hard time finding the source (partly because ChatGPT made up a new Samskrita verse haha - i.e. it turned part of Yudhishtira's answer into Yaksha's question).

For the reference, see [[Trying to find the reference for a verse|here]]. At first, I couldn't find it anywhere, until ChatGPT transcribed it, but even it could not find the verse in the book and got lost. And I could only find this transliteration referenced by Prabhupada in his lectures, and I couldn't find it in my copy of Mahabharata, which was actually a shortened version skipping those verses. The translation by KM Ganguli had it, but the reference was not clear, and ChatGPT didn't find it too. Eventually I had to use a Hare Krishna (again, back to Prabhupada) website to track it down and find it.

Anyways, although Prabhupada's works did lead to me finding the true source, this search also led to me finding some problematic stuff in his ways. For example, in this case, Prabhupada uses this insight for his agenda, by claiming that logic is futile and disgusting, and only devotion according to his way can lead to good living and attainment of truth. I took more notes about it here: [[Problems with ISKCON and its founder Prabhupada]].

Liberation: Kaivalya (Advaita), Vaikuntha (Vaishnava Dvaita), Kailasa (Shaiva Dvaita)

**About Raaja Yoga:**

Basically it is "the king of Yoga", or the best path. That is, it's practices lead to total realization or Turiya. It can also be understood as the path of a king, or to awaken the king within oneself.

From Hath Yoga Pradipika, Chapter 4, Verses 3-7:

> राजयोगः समाधिश्च उन्मनी च मनोन्मनी | अमरत्वं लयस्तत्त्वं शून्याशून्यं परं पदम || ३ ||
> अमनस्कं तथाद्वैतं निरालम्बं निरञ्जनम | जीवन्मुक्तिश्च सहजा तुर्या चेत्येक-वाचकाः || ४ ||
> सलिले सैन्धवं यद्वत्साम्यं भजति योगतः | तथात्म-मनसोरैक्यं समाधिरभिधीयते || ५ ||
> यदा संक्ष्हीयते पराणो मानसं च परलीयते | तदा समरसत्वं च समाधिरभिधीयते || ६ ||
> तत-समं च दवयोरैक्यं जीवात्म-परमात्मनोः | परनष्ह्ट-सर्व-सङ्कल्पः समाधिः सोऽभिधीयते || ७ ||
> 
> Raaja Yoga, Samaadhi, Unmani, Manonmani, Amaratva, Laya, Tatva, Shoonya, Ashoonya, Param Padama, Amanaska, Advaita, Niraalamba, Niranjana, Jeevan Mukti, Sahaja and Turiya denote the same state of being.
> 
> Just as with salt dissolved in water becomes one with it, so the union of Atman and Manas (mind) is denominated Samaadhi.
> 
> When the breath becomes exhausted, and mind becomes Praliyate (still, reabsorbed), they fuse into union called Samaadhi. This equality, this oneness of the two, the living self and the absolute self, when all Sankalpa (desire, cravings) end is called Samaadhi.

From Wikipedia:

> Some medieval Indian texts on Yoga list Raaja Yoga as one of many types of Yoga. For example, the 17th-century Sarvanga Yoga Pradipikam, a Braj-Bhaashya commentary by Sundardas, teaches three tetrads of Yogas.
> 
> - The first group is Bhakthi Yoga, Mantra Yoga, Laya Yoga, and Charcha Yoga
> - The second is Hathaa Yoga, Raaja Yoga, Laksha Yoga, and Ashtaanga Yoga
> - The third is Saankhya Yoga, Jnaana Yoga, Brahma Yoga, and Advaita Yoga.
>  
> Of the twelve, Sundardas states that Rajayoga is the best yoga.

About Shaivism:

> Shiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an **omniscient yogi** who lives an ascetic life on **Kailasa** as well as a **householder** with his **wife Parvati** and his **two children**, **Ganesha** and **Kartikeya**. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as **Adiyogi** (the first yogi), regarded as the patron god of **yoga**, meditation and the arts.
> 
> The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the **serpent king Vasuki** around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river **Ganga** flowing from his matted hair, the **third eye** on his forehead (the eye that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the **trishula or trident** as his weapon, and the **damaru**.
> 
> He is usually worshiped in the **aniconic** form of **lingam**.

> There are at least eight different versions of the Shiva Sahasranama, devotional hymns (stotras) listing many names of Shiva. The version appearing in Book 13 (Anuśāsanaparvan) of the Mahabharata provides one such list. Shiva also has Dasha-Sahasranamas (10,000 names) that are found in the Mahanyasa. The Shri Rudram Chamakam, also known as the Śatarudriya, is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.

Sahasra Naama:

> **Sahasranama** are medieval Indian texts that list a thousand names derived from aspects and epithets of a deity. They are devotional hymns (stotras), containing thousands of names of the deity.

Hysteresis Analogy:

From Wikipedia page on Vaasanaa:

> Writing from an Advaita Vedanta perspective, Waite refers to a model offered by Edward de Bono:
> 
> If you take a jelly, solidified and turned out onto a plate, and you trickle very hot water onto the top, it will run off onto the plate and leave behind a faint channel where the hot water melted the jelly. If you now pour more hot water, it will tend to run into the same channels as before, since these offer the line of least resistance, and deepen the channels. If this is done repeatedly, very deep channels will form and it will become difficult, if not impossible, to get the water to run anywhere else. The equivalent of an entrenched habit has been formed.
