This is written in reference to [[How to Scale text in different Scripts]].

Basically, different scripts have different number of graphemes, and they can represent a different number of phonemes. It should seem like there is no correlation. But when you make it so that you can fairly easily represent each phonogram using another script, the length of phonograms will turn out to be similar due to information density.

After that, it is only necessary to align the letters to equivalent sizes.

Now, why I emphasized phonograms was beca
