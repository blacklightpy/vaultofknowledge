# Dynamic IP
- Mesh with Dynamic IPs for Peers
	- WireGuard Endpoint Discovery and NAT Traversal using DNS-SD: https://www.jordanwhited.com/posts/wireguard-endpoint-discovery-nat-traversal/
		- Uses `wgsd`
			- Uses DNS-Service Discovery to discover ports of the tunnels of two endpoints, to connect them
			- CoreDNS plugin (`wgsd`) runs on the third party server to facilitate DNS-SD via a DNS Zone
			- `wgsd-client` on one endpoint queries the third party server for the details of the other peers
			- WIth the information, the hole is punched using `wgsd-client` via the DNS Zone.
			- `wsgd-client` also keeps the information about peers up to date, running as a cron job.
	- `github:WireGuard/wg-dynamic`: Official, but dead
	- `github:segator/wireguard-dynamic`: Unofficial, working

- NOTE: Just use Tailscale with Headscale. It is built for this.
	- Compared to Nebula: No need to transfer certificates, built on fast userspace WireGuard
	- Compared to WireGuard Dynamic Mesh (`wgsd`): No need to use DNS-SD, and can run on Windows
	- Compared to WireGuard Hub and Spoke: No Hub bottleneck, faster communications
	- Compared to NetMaker: Internet Gateway is free, and full mesh capability for all platforms
	- <span style="color:lightblue">[BEST COMPETITION]</span> Compared to NetBird: Better UI?
	- Compared to `wg-meshconf`: Supports Dynamic IPs and NATs
	- Compared to `wiresmith`: Supports all platforms, and supports Dynamic IPs and NATs, not all devices have IPv6
	- Compared to Tinc: Uses tried and tested WireGuard protocol, has a better UI
	- <span style="color:lightblue">[SECOND BEST]</span> Compared to ZeroTier: Fully free license, and tried and tested WireGuard protocol
	- Compared to `autowire`: Not all devices have IPv6
