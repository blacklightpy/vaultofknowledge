The qualify, I do not imply the Arabic word that means the "recitation", but rather the text that's attributed to Mohammed and used by his followers worldwide as the "word of Allah".

Also, the Arabic word "Allah", or "al-ilah" means "the one to be worshipped", and I do not believe a desire for worship is an aspect of god, just as I do would not desire for anything to worship me, even if I created them, like in a story or as a robot.

Write about how people cannot be forced to choose or reject an operating system by analyzing every aspect of it.

But when it comes to religion, the interpretations of certain people pose a threat. And by the probability that I have mentioned above.

A text that is from an intelligent source, and advocates for the well-being of sentient beings will not have such a large semantic distance.


I know it is a bad time for Muslims, but the thing is, it's always a bad time for Muslims, because they always want to cause problems for non-Muslims. Oh, not the individuals, just a few in the community.
