Similar to Sankhya, but different.

Instead of one Purusha, I consider Brahman divides into Purusha and Sthree. Brahman is one, but its aspects are dual, and hence the two are dual, yet one. This is just like how water has oxygen and hydrogen, and both give different properties, yet water is one. And they are always addressed as they, but by the singular word, god.

Then they create a common world, which is like a dream, but not exactly, because it is a shared world. They create a nature that adheres to certain rules temporarily, to explore it playfully.

This is because infinity cannot be reduced to determinism, and thus they explore different worlds and possibilities.

The worlds are created with a feminine and masculine aspects, each of them controlling one. So when beings reproduce, the offsprings are created with a compromise on how much of each characteristics they get, and if one remains predominant.

And most living beings are controlled by one of them, while the others appear to be sentient, but are only part of the world. All beings are not conscious themselves even though they have minds, and only have as much control over their lives as a child who plays with a toy steering wheel matching the turns his dad makes with the real steering wheel has on a car. That is, god controls your life, and your will is really god's will.

So when you forget that, you come into conflict with your own self, and life gets muddy. But it's a part of playing a game or watching a movie that is immersive, so much that you confuse yourself with the character you are playing. Perfection is not something to be aspired for, because the infinite can never allow notions of perfection, and a world itself is created upon arbitrary values. This is the principle of Samsaara, and liberation is achieved upon your realization of it, when the world stops appearing as something that's randomly evolving, and you see it for what it is - a gameplay.

The role of god is just like the role of the father and the mother, to bring up and nurture the child in their images. But it is also like the role of a father in bringing a boy up to be a man, or a girl up to be a woman, in line with which aspect predominates them. This also involves the role of the parents in bringing up an intersex child as equal, and a transgender child by changing their original understanding.

And just as a parent slowly removes control over a child's life as they realize that they're becoming more like them without supervision, god also loosens their grip over a person as they imbibe his image more clearly, with less supervision. But the role of god is never completely removed, as one always is a virtual manifestation in the image of the real god.

Thus the purpose of the world is also for you to evolve, so that the world does not have to be destroyed, but be made to grow and be enjoyable in of itself. That is, like a video game that doesn't end, and you can create your own video games from within it.
