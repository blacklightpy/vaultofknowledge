I'll start with no understanding.

Firstly, I'll have to trust what I see and hear from my senses: **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception)
Then I'll have to understand how things behave to know how they interact: **Anumaana** (Reasoning)
Then I'll have to understand the other aspects of life from my guardians and others: **Shabda** (Testimony)
Then I'll have to seek the right understanding of reality for myself: **Para Vidya** (Ultimate Knowledge)

Actually, turns out this was the same way in Advaita Vedaanta. See [[Pramaana-s]]]
