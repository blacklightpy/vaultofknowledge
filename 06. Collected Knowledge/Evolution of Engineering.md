Historic engineering processes rarely ever go out of use because all modern infrastructure is ultimately derived from them, and cannot be recreated without them.

For example, to build a transistor, you need to melt the silicon, for which you need iron tools, to get which you'll need to initially use wooden or stone tools and so on.

Let's explore creation of technology in this manner!
