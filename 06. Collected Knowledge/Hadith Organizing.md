	- Contradiction: "The deceased neither see us, feel our call or hear us from their graves."
	- Contradiction: Do not cry at the graves

# Rough
## My claims
- Mohammed wanted to rule
- In doing so, his actions were evil
- He used the name of God and rewards to fool Arabs
- Like a good Mafia boss, he couldn't do so without helping his people, and hurting others
	- So the Omerta was the belief in Allah (apostates would be killed)
	- So, what is this Allah?
- Since his actions were evil, evil always leaves a loophole

- What is Al-Ilah (Definition)
	- Al-Ilah means the one to be worshipped
	- Or else, it would've said Al-Khaliqu (The creator)
	- Rather, it says Allah is "the creator" and "the one to be worshipped"
	- That cannot be true, because a creator doesn't need worship

- What is Allah (Rational)
	- Is Allah closer to that of a land, or a king?
	- That is, is he a person, who has a persona, or a mask?
	- Or is he something in between, that is, neither a person, nor a land?
	- const. India [...]
	- Bharat Mata or Uncle Sam

- What is Satan?
	- Satan would then be the abstract personification of evil

- What is the evil?
	- He needed to turn one set of people against another
	- To do that, he needed to make them believe that many innocent actions by humans were evil
	- In doing so, he asked of humans to cast aside their humanity and worship the one who gave this law
	- Since that law is evil, who is the personification of evil? Satan

- Main Criticism
	- The Qur'an narrated by Mohammed as revelation from God was neither truth, nor one that was made with an inclination towards goodness. However, the Hebrew TaNaKh and Christian Bible were made with an inclination towards good, and that is the basic difference. Of the two, the Jewish teaching remains more rational, because of its completion only with the combination of the Mishnah and Gemara of the Talmud, which is revised according to debates.
	- And the fact that Jews do debate is precisely the reason why the Yeshua accused them of "altering the true word of God", and claiming that the prophecy of "heaven" will be satisfied in an outside world.
		- And of course, people can sacrifice their lives to do that. We've seen Muslims do this, and we've seen the Jonestown Massacre and the Aum Shinrikyo cult. They are world-denying
### Plan
- Criticizing Islam 

- What Mohammed was
	- My idea: Mohammed was either misguided or evil, and he hated several things, and he said that it is divine law for others to hate the same things. He also stole the teachings of the Jewish culture, and claimed that he was the true descendant of Abraham in faith, through his son Ishmael. He also made himself some exceptions for honour and convenience such as his ability to have multiple wives while others are limited to having just four, and that his wives cannot have other husbands if they are divorced. He also dehumanized other human relationships when he said that captive women are valid for sexual intercourse regardless of marrying them, and their marriages with disbelieving husbands are nullified.
	- Alternate Idea 1:
	- Alternate Idea 2:
	- Muslim Idea:
- What Muslims of today are:
### Strategies Muslims use to prevent criticism
- The six named strategies
	- Kitman (telling you only a part of the truth) (Ibadis call Taqiyya Kitman)
		- You can read the Quran to get the full truth
	- Tawriyyah ("creative lying", doublespeak without breaking the letter of oath)
		- You can read the Tafsirs to bypass Tawriyyah.
		- Also, read the Ahadith of Ahl as-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah
		- Also read classic textbooks on Islamic History like The History of Al-Tabari
	- Muruna (Loopholes to allow one to fit in with Kafirs without trouble)
		- They do this for the higher purpose of gaining more influence
		- Based on an interpretation of 2:106 (abrogation verse)
			- Basically, they follow Meccan laws first
	- Taqiyyah / Muda'rat (Lying about one's religion when one is threatened)
	- Taysir (Deceit by not observing Shariah, during war (as Mohammed said))
	- ~~Daruna (Deceit through necessary Haram)~~
		- It is for survival tactics only
	- ~~Hiyal (Legalized trickery for sticking to Shariah without following it perfectly)~~
		- e.g. Rebranding interest as fee/profit, Rebranding Jihad as purely an inner struggle
		- It is forbidden in Islaam
- They alter the meanings we've agreed upon in earlier contexts to suit the current context (exploiting on the brain's attention span) <span style="color:lightblue">[EX: saying that Islam didn't allow slaves to be made, after establishing that it did earlier on.]</span>
# Women (general and married)

## Quran

**Right to Strike Women**

> [Quran 4:34](https://quranx.com/4.34 "quranx.com"): Sahih Intl  
> Allah: Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

## Bukhari/Muslim

**Mohammed Struck Aisha: (struck, pain changed to nudged, felt in Sunnah.com)**

> [Sahih Muslim 974 b](http://hadithcollection.com/sahihmuslim/132-Sahih%20Muslim%20Book%2004.%20Prayer/9023-sahih-muslim-book-004-hadith-number-2127.html "hadithcollection.com"):  
> He said: Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransom for you, and then I told him (the whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your shadow) that I saw in front of me? I said: Yes. He struck me on the chest which caused me pain, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal unjustly with you?

**Majority of woman are in Hell. Women are deficient in intelligence, and religion. Gives "proof".**

> [Sahih al-Bukhari 304](http://sunnah.com/bukhari:304 "sunnah.com"):  
> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri: Once Allah's Messenger went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Messenger! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."

**Women are the worst trial for men**

> [Sahih al-Bukhari 5096](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/34 "sunnah.com"):  
> Narrated Usama bin Zaid: The Prophet said, "After me I have not left any trial more severe to men than women."

**Seeing a woman, dog or donkey annuls prayer**

> [Sahih al-Bukhari 514](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/8/161 "sunnah.com"):  
> Narrated Aisha: The things which annul prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, "You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet."

**Women and donkeys disrupt prayer**

> [Sahih Muslim 512 c](http://sunnah.com/muslim/4/304 "sunnah.com"):  
> 'Urwa b. Zubair reported: 'A'isha asked: What disrupts the prayer? We said: The woman and the ass. Upon this she remarked: Is the woman an ugly animal? I lay in front of the Messenger of Allah like the bier of a corpse and he said prayer.

**Bad omen is in the horse, woman and the house**

> [Sahih al-Bukhari 5095](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/33 "sunnah.com"):  
> Narrated Sahl bin Saad: Allah's Messenger said, "If at all there is bad omen, it is in the horse, the woman, and the house."

**Other women are like the devil (sexually attractive), so when you see a woman, he should go to his wive and have sex**

> [Sahih Muslim 1403 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim/16/10 "sunnah.com"):
> Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger saw a woman, and so he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning a leather and had sexual intercourse with her. He then went to his Companions and told them:  
> The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.

**Believing women are to be beat until their skin colour changes.**
> [Sahih al-Bukhari 5825](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5825):
> Narrated 'Ikrima:
> 
> Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon 'AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. 'Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, 'Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!" When 'AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, "By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this," holding and showing the fringe of her garment, 'Abdur-Rahman said, "By Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa'a." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, to her, "If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa'a unless 'Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) saw two boys with 'Abdur- Rahman and asked (him), "Are these your sons?" On that 'AbdurRahman said, "Yes." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow,"
## Other Sahih
**Permission to Umar to beat his wife. He rebuked the women who complained**

> [Sunan Abi Dawud 2146](http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/101 "sunnah.com"): Sahih, Al-AlbaniIyas ibn Abdullah ibn Abu Dhubab reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: Do not beat Allah's handmaidens, but when Umar came to the Messenger of Allah and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them. Then many women came round the family of the Messenger of Allah complaining against their husbands. So the Messenger of Allah said: Many women have gone round Muhammad's family complaining against their husbands. They are not the best among you.

**A man should not be asked why he beats his wife**

> [Sunan Ibn Majah 9:2062](http://sunnah.com/urn/1263050 "sunnah.com"): Hasan, DarussalamIt was narrated that Ash'ath bin Qais said: "I was a guest (at the home) of 'Umar one night, and in the middle of the night he went and hit his wife, and I separated them. When he went to bed he said to me: 'O Ash'ath, learn from me something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah" A man should not be asked why he beats his wife, and do not go to sleep until you have prayed the Witr."' And I forgot the third thing."

**Pray to Allah for the good in her, and pray for protection from the evil in her**

> [Sunan Abi Dawud 2160](http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/115 "sunnah.com"):  
> 'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that his grandfather (Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As) reported the Prophet said: If one of you marries a woman or buys a slave, he should say: "O Allah, I ask You for the good in her, and in the disposition You have given her; I take refuge in You from the evil in her, and in the disposition You have given her." When he buys a camel, he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing.  
> Abu Dawud said: Abu Sa'id added the following words in his version: He should then take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing in the case of a woman or a slave.

**Wives should prostrate to their husbands**

> [Jami\` at-Tirmidhi 1159](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/12/14 "sunnah.com"): Hasan, Darussalam  
> Abu Hurairah narrated that The Prophet said:  
> “If I were to order anyone to prostrate to anyone, then I would order the wife to prostrate to her husband.”

**Wives should prostrate to their husbands. And if he asks her for intimacy, she should not refuse even if she is on her camel saddle.**

> [Sunan ibn Majah 9:1926](https://sunnah.com/urn/1261700 "sunnah.com"):  
> It was narrated that: Abdullah bin Abu Awfa said “When Muadh bin Jabal came from Sham, he prostrated to the Prophet who said: 'What is this, O Muadh?' He said: 'I went to Sham and saw them prostrating to their bishops and patricians and I wanted to do that for you.' The messenger of Allah said: 'Do not do that. If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad! No woman can fulfill her duty towards Allah until she fulfills her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.”

**If a woman leads people, they will not prosper.**

> [Sunan an-Nasa'i 5388](https://sunnah.com/nasai:5388):
> It was narrated that Abu Bakrah said:
> 
> "Allah protected me with something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah [SAW]. When Chosroes died, he said: 'Whom have they appointed as his successor?' They said: 'His daughter.' He said: 'No people will ever prosper who entrust their leadership to a woman.'"

## Scholarly Works

**If a woman commits any open indecency, you can shut them in separate rooms and beat them, but not severely.**

> [The History of Al-Tabari, tr. & ann. by Ismail K Poonawala (1990), Vol 09, page 113](https://archive.org/stream/TabariEnglish/Tabari_Volume_09#page%2Fn129%2Fmode%2F2up "archive.org"):  
> “They should not commit any open indecency (fāꜧishah). If they do then God permits you to shut them in separate rooms and beat them, but not severely. If they abstain from [evil] they’ve a right to food and clothing in accordance with custom (bi’l-ma’rũf). Treat women well [for] they are [like] domestic animals (‘awān) with you and do not possess anything for themselves.
