According to Hindu Metaphysics, Brahman is the ultimate reality.
Brahman creates the world, which is described differently in different Darshanas.
The physical reality is formed by the aspect of Maya, which veils absolute reality from physical reality.

It is questioned whether Maya is under the control of Brahman or not in different Darshanas.
It is questioned whether Maya is the veil that veils the Dualistic or Non-Dualistic nature of Brahman.
It is questioned whether Brahman includes an aspect called Ishvara that creates the Maya.


Darshana is a word that means perspectives.
The Darshana that there is an Ishvara is called Dvaita Darshana, or dualist perspective.
The Darshana of Dvaita is one of the Darshanas of the Darshana called Vedanta.
Vedanta refers to the late philosophy known as the end or summary of the Vedas.

In Dvaita Darshana, people consider Brahman to be Saguna, or comprised of all attributes.


According to Vaishnavas who follow Dvaita Vedanta, Krishna is the Ishvara.
And Krishna creates Maya for the sake of his enjoyment, or Leela.
That is because Krishna is a prankster.

Vaishnava is the sect that considers Vishnu as Para Brahman.
