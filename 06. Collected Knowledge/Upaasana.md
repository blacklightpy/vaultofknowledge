It does not mean "worship," because it's usage in Chhandogya Upanishad for example, points out that it refers to "meditation."

**Chhandogya Upanishad 7.1.5:**

> **IAST Transliteration:**
> 
> sa yo nāma brahmetyupāste yāvannāmno gataṃ tatrāsya yathākāmacāro bhavati yo nāma brahmetyupāste'sti bhagavo nāmno bhūya iti nāmno vāva bhūyo'stīti tanme bhagavānbravītviti ||
> 
> **Translation:**
> 
> ‘Anyone who worships name as Brahman can do what he pleases within the limits of the name.’ Nārada asked, ‘Sir, is there anything higher than name?’ ‘Of course there is something higher than name,’ replied Sanatkumāra. Nārada then said, ‘Sir, please explain that to me’.

Here, "brahmetyupāste" translates to "worships (subject) as Brahman". But Brahman is never worshipped, and is only "meditated" upon. That makes sense for Upaasana of deities too, because the concept of Upaasana is different from Bhakthi, and the notion of surrender and subservience is not extant in Indian religions.

To resolve the confusion, as later the passage also refers to meditation as Dhyaana, Upaasana means "giving undivided attention," or "meditation on something" while Dhyaana is to stay in unattached knowledge.
