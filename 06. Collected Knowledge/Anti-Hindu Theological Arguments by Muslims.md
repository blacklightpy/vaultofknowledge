# Mohammedan Metaphysics Joke

Claim: "Hindus worship the creation and not the creator"
Example: In replies to https://old.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/147a67f/was_prophet_nuh_sent_to_india/ (BTW it makes the claim that Suwa = Shiva, and I saw it in Page 188 of Al-Tabari Vol. 8, in section: The Destruction of Idolatrous Shrines)

Fix: These Muslims have to be taught some metaphysics.

e.g.
- Dualism
	- God is Separate from the Universe (And is Jealous) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Abrahamic]</span>
	- God is Separate from the Universe (And is not Jealous) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Dvaita Vedanta]</span>
	- God is Separate from the Universe (And has left it) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Deism]</span>
	- Multiple Gods Exist (And people respect all of them) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Polytheism]</span>
	- Multiple Gods Exist (And people worship one of them) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Monolatry]</span>
	- God has created Gods to Manage Realities <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Sanskrit Vedas]</span>
- Monism
	- Everything is God (And God is Active) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Advaita Vedanta / Pan-Theism]</span>
	- Everything is God (And God is Inactive) <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Pan-Desim]</span>
- Between Monism and Dualism
	- Everything is a Part of God <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Pan-En-Theism]</span>
	- We Cannot Know the Difference Between God and Nature <span style="color:#8c90f9">[Achintya Bheda Abhedha]</span>
