# Old Testament
## Old Testament and Talmud
- Old Testament
	- Hatred of Pagans (Reason)
		- Psalms 106:37
	- Story of Lot and Gomorrah
	- Samson's Marriage
		- Judges 14:16
	- Don't Hide Your Sins (Good)
		- Proverbs 28:13
- Talmud
	- Sanhedrin 43a (Stoning Jesus)
		- He violated Deuteronomy 13:11-12 (Misleading people) and Leviticus 20:27 (Spirit Telling).

Sin (chet) is a result of improper channeling of our human impulses (Yetzer). We have Yetzer-Hatov (Good Inclination) and Yetzer-Hara (Good/Bad Inclination). And God forgives.

It is commonly said that Israel claimed to be superior than the others. But really, Israel only claims to be people chosen for a purpose. A commonly cited Talmud excerpt (Yevamot 62a.14) is that the Israelites consider Gentiles to be like donkeys, considering it to be pejorative. However, that was only a metaphoric tool used for declaring the legal status of the lineage a Gentile who wants to be Jew. The term donkey is not used in a pejorative sense.

The reality on how Israel views Gentiles is given in another excerpt where the Israelites consider Gentiles to be like dogs and themselves to be like donkeys. So when we walk the Earth, the commandments are like luggage. And the dogs, tired of the luggage, placed the burden on the donkeys, so that they both can walk in comfort. So the reference to dogs was only made in the sense that Israelites work harder for the sake of the Gentiles. This is from Sifrei Devarim 343:6 (donkey is written as ass, in case you don't see it with Ctrl+F). Sifrei Devarim is a Midrash text on the Book of Deuteronomy composed in 200 CE by Rabbi Akiva.

However, Mohammed said that they are like donkeys carrying around the Torah, by not understanding its contents (Quran 62:5).


Also, sin of Sodom was not explicitly mentioned as homosexuality by any prophets. They were only mentioned as wicked.
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&pg=PA37&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false
It was the Church that decided to call homosexuality the sin, although the prophets only refer to Sodom the city.
The people of Sodom tried to mass-rape the two heavenly emissaries.

## Notes on where and how the laws apply
**Old Testament:**
- Lev 20:24-26 states that the rules (Lev 20:13, etc.) are for the people of Israel.
- It is also the responsibility of the Judges (Dt 17:6-9).
- Lev 1:1-2 states that the book is for Israel.

**New Testament:**
- We are in the Church age (Eph 3:1-5).
- The Church cannot punish sinners, only the government can (Romans 13:1-4).
- Lord will deal with Israel in the End Times (Rev 7-19).
- Paul is the Apostle of the Gentiles (Rom 11:11-13).
- But only a small portion of the Bible is to Gentiles, most others are to Israel.
- Bible doesn't specify or condemn death penality to homosexuals. But it doesn't oppose.
- Romans 13:1-4 gives the state the power to execute criminals, but doesn't specify what is criminal.

- God doesn't always want what's moral.
- He wants his plan done.

## Nature of Christians outside the Bible
- How Christians are in practice
https://www.gotquestions.org/father-of-lies.html
> Some of his more common lies are “there is no God,” “God doesn’t care about you,” “the Bible cannot be trusted,” and “your good works will get you into heaven.”

Christians justify that God ordered to kill all babies.
They justify that if God says so, killing people is moral.

They say that death is everywhere and humans cannot be united.
This is wishful thinking.
## Evils of Christianity
- Salem Witch Trials (massacre of educated women)
- Antisemitic Pogroms (massacre of Jews)
- Anti-Abortion campaigns (against rational philosophy)
- Persecution of LGBTQIA+ (dangerous to mental health, violation of humanity)
- Terrorist attacks (minimal in the modern world, but radicals exist)

		- People say that killing baby Hitler is okay, but not killing any babies by knowing of their potential evil nature. But they ignore something fundamental about how evil arises as an emergent phenomena, not as something spiritual.
	- Taking Sex Slaves
		- They have to take care of the captive women, and they can get intimate with them without nikah
			- Exceptions are pregnant women and women whose husbands are also made captives
			- But all adults are killed during war, so husbands cannot actually be captured.
		- 23:5-7 (Those who lose chastity not with wives or sex-slaves are transgressors)
		- 4:3 (Content yourselves with one of your bondwomen, if you can't treat 4 wives justly)
			- Christianity also sets the number of wives to one.
			- In Judaism, the number of wives was ideally one.
		- 70:29-31 (Same as 23:5-7, verbatim)
		- 4:24 (Married female captives are legal for marriage)
		- 4:25 (Impatient men who can't find a free Muslim woman should be given a **Muslim\*** slave women to marry, if the master hasn't had relations with them)
			- True\* translation (doubtful, I guess I'm wrong by most Tafsirs): It says slaves of Muslims should be given, not Muslims slaves. I read the Arabic translation (maybe my bad).
			- More Notes:
				- This is for impatient men. They can't marry slaves if they have free wives. (But what about Aisha Mohammed Hadith? I'll see)
					- But they can marry multiple slaves, although if they already have one wife, they can't be considered impatient? Scholars vary. Some say he's satisfied, others say one can have upto 4 wives to be satisfied.
				- Owners can't marry slaves without freeing them. But he can have sex.
					- This is because the contract of ownership is stronger than the contract of marriage. And one cannot have both, the contract of ownership supersedes, until she's freed.
						- And this is because the contracts of marriage give more rights that the contracts of slavery does not. So if she's not given those rights, it will make a contradiction.
			- **Now, why would a slave believe? What would she gain?**
				- The master can have sex with her whether she believes or not, so no gain.
				- Some impatient guy can have sex with her if she believes, so a downside.
				- Also acceptance of Islam nullifies her previous marriage (if husband is alive), so, unfaithful.
				- Is she coerced?
		- 30:28 (Would you ever allow your slaves to be equal partners in wealth to you?)
		- 24:33 (Only guideline: do not make them prostitutes to earn money / pimp)
		- 33:50 (Have relationships with wives to whom you've paid dowry to, and slave women)
		- 66:1 (Why refuse what Allah has made lawful?)
			- 66:2-4 (you can break such oaths, and when the wives asked, he replied Allah said so)
			- 66:5 (if they are annoying, he may divorce you and Allah may give him other better wives)
			- But an earlier worse said nobody can marry his wives if he divorces them
			- 66:6-9 to change context to instill fear of hell
			- 66:10 verse about bad women (Lot's daughters)
			- 66:11 verse about obedient women
			- 66:12 verse about Mariam, the chaste
		- Freeing slaves to make up for sins is mentioned, but one could also just repent
		- A slave woman could reject her master for illness, etc.
		- Don't marry polytheist women, believing slaves are better
			- Although slaves by definition would be originally non-Muslims
		- Many Tafsirs say that one can force slaves to do nikah, or marry them off without consent
		- All Verses on "Right Hand Possesses"
			- 33:50 (Mohammed can have sex with his Wives, Slaves, Cousins or Believing Women Who Ask to be his wives (without Mehr))
			- Quran 33.52, Quran 4.3, Quran 30.28, 16:71, 23:6
			- Quran 23:5-6, Quran 70:27-30, Quran 4:24
	- Treatment of Slaves
		- If a slave woman is married by the owner, the children will be free
		- If a slave woman is married to another man, the children will be slaves of the owner
		- By marrying slaves off, the owner gets more slaves, and is lifted of the burden of accommodating them.
		- 16:71 (Do not give what Allah has gifted you to your slaves to be equal with them)
	- Polygamy is good for men, bad for women
	- Some Muslims think it's okay to lie during Dawah (invitation/preaching)
	- God split water and heavens
		- Quran 21:30 (Surah Yunus)
		- This is out of Genesis
		- Contradictions
			- God made every living thing (in Earth) out of water (21:30)
			- God make Jinn from smokeless flame (55:15)

				- Note how it doesn't say kill only those who fight, so all adult males are to be killed (ones with pubic hair).
	- Killing all adult males who had pubic hair after battle
		- Jami at-Tirmidhi (Saheeh)
			- **1584 (The Book on Military Expeditions, Hadeeth 41):** "We were presented to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the day of (the battle of) Quraizah. Whoever had pubic hair was killed and whoever did not was left to his way. I was of those who did not have pubic hair so I was left to my way." Abu 'Eisa said: This Hadith is Hasan Saheeh. This is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge. They consider pubic hair an indication of the age of responsibility, if it is not known whether he has had a wet dream, or his age. This is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq.

			- History
				- **The Split at Nahrawan**
					- The Kharijites formed by leaving 'Ali.
					- 'Abdallah ibn Wahb was chosen as the first Kharijite Imam.
						- Wahbi is seen as the purest Aqida of Islaam by Ibadis.
						- See the book "Al-'Aqida 'l-Wahbiyya" by Nasir ibn Salim ibn 'Udayyam al-Rawahi, a great poet also known as Abu Muslim, who wrote a poem in praise of the courage and faith of the thousands of Kharijite soldiers, including ibn Wahb, who met their death in the battle against 'Ali at al-Nahrawan.
					- He was killed at the battle of al-Nahrawan by Ali on 9 Shafar, 38 AH / 17 July, 658 CE.
					- Not all Khawarijis followed 'Abdallah ibn Wahb at Nahrawan.
				- **History of Khawarijis**
					- The Khawarijis were divided into militants (Shurat) and quietists (Qa'ada).
					- Someone assassinated 'Ali, and Mu'awiya, and members of his clan, Banu Umayya formed the Umayyad Khilafat, with its capital at Damascus, who ruled until they were overthrown by the 'Abbasids who made Bhagdad their capital and ruled from 132 AH / 750 CE to 656 AH / 1258 CE when the Mongol conquest happened.
					- Abu Bilal Mirdas ibn Udayya al-Tamimi was a a quietist Kharijite leader from Basra in southern Iraq.
					- He was the brother of one of the instigators of the Kharijite secession and a veteran of the massacre at Nahrawan, who disagreed with the violent tactics of the Khawarij, which included acceptance of the principle of Isti'rad (Religious Assassination).
					- Thus, Basra became a center of moderate Kharijism.
					- Abu Bilal was seen as a precursor of Ibadiyya.
				- **Split of the Ibadis**
					- After the death of second Umayyad Khalifa Yazid I, son of Mu'awiya in 64 AH / 683 CE, violent Khawarij rebellions formed.
					- The followers of Nafi' ibn al-Azraq, or the Azariqa attacked Basra, and the Omani Azd tribe of Basra attacked them and killed Nafi
					- Later, the Ummayad Khalifa 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was able to take control over all provinces of the Islamic empire.
					- The most prominent quietist position was held by 'Abdallah ibn Ibad, of whom very little is known.
					- It's based on his name that the Azariqas were contrasted with, as Ibadis.
				- "Abu 'l-Sha'tha'" Jabir ibn Zayd, an associate of Mohammed's cousin 'Abdallah ibn al-'Abbas is seen as the true organizer of the Ibadis, and the successor of 'Abdallah ibn Ibad.
				- Jabir had positive relations with Ummayad governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who supported moderate Khawirijis as a bulwark against the growth of Kharijite extremism.
				- When 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan died in 86 AH/705 CE and was succeeded by the pious 'Umbar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, many moderate Khawarij hoped for the realizations of a righteous Islamic imamate.
				- But many new quietist leaders wanted to take a more activist stance towards Jihaad.
				- Jabir himself felt compelled to take action, and instigated the assassination of one of al-Hajjaj's spies.
				- This led to a complete rupture in the relatively friendly relations the moderate Khawarij had enjoyed with the Umayyad regime.
				- Al-Hajjaj imprisoned many of them, and exiled many others to Oman.
				- Abu 'Ubayda Muslim ibn Abi Karima al-Tamimi was a student of Jabir ibn Zayd, who was among those who were imprisoned.
				- Abu 'Ubayda is seen as the second Ibadi Imam.
				- The first Ibadi political imamate was established in Hadramawt in 128 AH / 745 CE.
				- - Some History -
				- The Rustamid imamate was overthrown by Shi'ite Fatimids in 296 AH / 909 CE.
				- The fall of Rustamid and Omani imamates at the end of the 3rd (AH) / 9th (CE) centuries led to the development of the doctrines of Taqiyya (religious dissimulation) and Kitman (living in secret dissension from the ruling authorities)
				- In North Africa, the 'Azzaba councils developed to replace the Imamate.
				- Just as the decline in power of the 'Abbasid Khilafat led to Sunnis developing their jurisprudence, Ibadi scholars also wrote down the Ibadi doctrine and jurisprudence during this period (late 3rd (AH) / 9th (CE) century).
				- Then the rest is the history of Oman

# Specific Contexts in Islam
- Believe Hadeeths Verse
	- 4:80 (Obey Prophet)
	- 24:63 (Don't disobey him)
	- 4:65 (You won't be true believers until you accept him as your judge)
	- 8:24 (Respond to Allah and his messenger)
	- Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi’ and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying ‘I don’t accept it; we didn’t find any such thing in the Book of Allah.’” Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663).

- People justifying killing polytheists
	- Surah 9:5 isn't forbidden afterwards.
	- Also, treaty is irrelevant for when Muslims conquered the land, meaning a treaty was broken.
	- They remove parts of 2:191 saying drive them out from where they drove you out (meaning they came to attack you)
	- They reply, emotions will lead you to failure, and follow the jurisprudence books, like the Book of Jihad

## Philosophizing
- The claim that Islam made people release slaves
	- The idea is that slaves could be released, as one of the ways to erase sins
	- Suppose I could buy games for currency
	- Will I be inclined to spend currency for games, or to hoard currency?

Saheeh Bukhari 9:89:296 states “The Prophet (ﷺ) came to know that one of his companions had given the promise of freeing his slave after his death, but as he had no other property than that slave, the Prophet (ﷺ) sold that slave for 800 dirhams and sent the price to him.”

- Logical Inconsistency of Slaves
	- If both a wife and husband are slaves, the owner can't have sex with them
	- The slave girl can deny sex
	- The slave girl cannot be forced to work

You chose to humble yourselves. But who is it that you chose to humble yourselves towards?
You chose to humble yourselves towards someone who asked of you, to cast aside your humanity.
What does that make you?

**Killing people:**
Like-wise, the famous Hanafi scholar al-Kashani said, “The principle is that it is permissible to kill anyone from amongst the people who are at war (with the Muslims), whether they fight or do not fight.

Analysis of "Kafir's Blood Is Halal for You, So Shed It" (https://www.cell.com/heliyon/pdf/S2405-8440(20)31292-5.pdf). It studies the use of grammar to alter "mood and speech" to make them hate "Mushirikins".

**The problem with taking a religion ("no contradictions"):**
Say I sharpen a pencil. I can put the waste in my box (in a waste section), or walk up to the dustbin. Is there a contradiction in any of these actions? No. But someone can put it on the floor. It could be argued that it is harmful for the environment or the workers. But the person could say that they don't care about workers or the environment. Now, to change his mind is a very difficult task. Although there are no contradictions in this situation, there are contradictions when you consider the larger picture.

**What I mean when I say Islam is harmful:**
When I say that I know that Islam is harmful, even more than Muslims, I say it in a similar manner as I know that Alcohol is harmful even without drinking alcohol myself. Of course, moderate alcoholics do not pose a problem, but I can still know that if someone gets them to try something stronger, and being alcoholics, they are less likely to 

But realistically
Hell, it is even realistic for Christianity.


- **Who all can be captives?**
	- Claim: Only females who fight can be captured
	- Claim: Only men who fight can be killed.

- **What happens when you fight**
	- People of the Book can pay Jizya
	- Others will have to be fought till they convert
		- **Hanafi School:** Jizya can be taken from everyone except Arab polytheists and apostates
		- **Maliki School:** Jizya can be taken from everyone except apostates
		- **Shafi'i and Hanbali Schools:** Jizya can be taken from Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians (Ahl al-Kitab)

- 9:29 (Take Jizya only from those who were given the Scripture)

This guy quotes Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb's fatwa for Jizya (to not take it from Hindus): (https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2e5utf/comment/kqi8g8i/)

He also says that Fitrah is innate to all humans, and it is only later in life that they are indoctrinated to Christianity and Atheism. And he complains that the rules of Jizya are perfect even to those who are denied it, unlike the western world which lets everyone live, because it is according to the whims of man, while Islam is the unwavering absolute truth as commanded by God.

| The UN declared a partition plan, but the Arabs rejected it. That is because the Arabs can never agree to peace.                                                                                                                                                                             | Established a treaty with them, but they didn't follow it.

| They didn't start a battle, but the Arabs fought them when they went with the partition plan. So they fought the battle, but they didn't kill everyone. Instead, 20% of Israelis are Arabs. And they didn't collect something like Jizya from them to humiliate them to let them live there. | So they killed every single member of those tribes, "except those from The People of The Book (Ahl Al-Kitab)", "who paid Jizya tax", "in humiliation to Islam" (Surah 9, Ayah 5). |

# Detailing Counters

- Aisha's age (8 min video, by Towards Eternity)
	- **Video Type:** Appealing vocal music (sounds like snake charming)
	- **Rhetoric:**
		- "Islamophobes use these arguments to turn Muslims away."
		- "They want to paint the idea that prophet was a lustful man."
		- "One of the things hypocrites have been talking about"
		- "They accuse his of being, Ma'adhallah, a lustful person"
		- "It's a slander. How? Simply by looking at the life of our prophet Ali Salat Wasallam"
	- **Premise: Libido begins at puberty, at 12, remains high till 40 and descends. At that time, it was a bit earlier.**
		- Status: Questionable
	- 1. Prophet married his first wife only at 25, a late age.
	- 2. His first wife was not 16, but was 40.
		- Khadija was a widow with three children.
		- She proposed to Mohammed, because he was known for being handsome.
		- He was also known for his ethics, and he was chaste and honest person. (Questionable)
		- He'd never lied, so much that others called him El-Amin (The Trustworthy). (Questionable)
		- Even his enemies trusted their belongings to him (Questionable).
		- So it was easy for him to marry any girl he wanted, yet he chose a 40 year old.
		- Was it for lust then? (My claim: Neutral, beauty is subjective, and could've been skill issue)
	- 3. When she became an old woman and lost her beauty, he didn't think of marrying another woman (My claim: Neutral, beauty is subjective)
	- 3. He only married after she died, after he was 51. Was it for lust then?
	- 4. 

- Same video or next? That No one in the past blamed Mohammed for marrying Aisha.
	- I think, next video, 4:00 and forward

- Normal person's viewpoint
	- 1. Mohammed was not a likable person, so that's probably why he didn't get women.
	- 2. He was 40 (15 years into marriage when he began to preach)
	- 3. His wife died 10 years later, aged 65 (Year of Sorrow)
	- 4. He moved to Medina after that, and he gained power
	- 5. That's where he married 10 new wives
	- 6. Prophet had sex with slaves (beats the argument that he was not lustful)
	- 7. Prophet had sex with a child (pedophilia)
	- 8. The child's parents were Muslim (beats the claim that they were from other tribes)

- Aisha's age (50 min video)
	- **Video Type:** Prophet Salallahu Ali Wassalam His Ali Wassalam wife Aisha Ali Wasslam

- Claim that Aisha was older: https://old.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/tptmn/the_ages_of_asma_bint_abi_bakr_and_aisha_bint_abi/
	- It's from non-Saheeh Hadith like Tafsir Ibn Kathir
- Other claim, by Yaqeen Institute: https://yaqeeninstitute.org/tag/more-than-just-a-number-perspectives-on-the-age-of-aisha-ra (Papers, Video Collections, Infographic)
- Others claim Bukhari isn't reliable - but that's a shortly held opinion

- I'm not trying to shame Mohammed, I'm just proving that it is just the way of a medieval tribe.
- I do not find shame in pedophilia, I only find that it is wrong, as the child is not mature.
- I do not believe in punishing those who do wrong, only correcting them.
- Retributive Justice culture is a Middle Eastern problem.
- **My problem is with people bringing the medieval ways to the 21st century.**

- People justifying child marriage
	- https://luk.staff.ugm.ac.id/kmi/off/XIslam/USA/chap0302.html (Excerpt of a letter sent to Egyptian editor)
		- Husband's friend liked her 9 year old daughter, and agreed to marry her.
		- He announced it with great joy.
		- When she objected, he said, he's following the prophet's example in al-Bukhari.
	- Same article (Excerpt of a letter sent to the same editor by a police officer)
		- Man of 84 wanted to marry a 14 year old, and he was invited
		- He asked why he wants to marry a child
		- He said that his three wives became old, and when a woman gets old, she will be like a rusty car.

# Stupidities 2
- Prohibition of Alcohol (to verify)
	- Alcohol was sign from Allah. Then it changed after drunk Hamza insulted Mohammed as his family slave.
	- 16:67 Intoxication used to be among the signs from Allah
	- 47:15 (Wine will be a reward in paradise)
	- 4:43 (Don't go to prayer while drunk)
	- 5:90-91 (Alcohol is from Satan)

			- Quran Order: 47 (Revelation Order: 90)
			- Quran Order: 4 (Revelation Order: 92)
			- Quran Order: 5 (Revelation Order: 112)
	- Clearly, the explicit prohibition came in 5, later (16, 47, 4, 5)
	- al-Bukhari Hadith 2375 (Book 42 (Distribution of Water), Hadith 23)
		- Hamza was drinking wine. Mohammed went to Hamza and spoke harshly to him. Hamza asked him, aren't you only the slaves of my forefathers? Mohammed went out. This happened before the prohibition of drinking.
	- One article says prohibition was revealed after Hijrah

- Other verses about alcohol:
	- 2:219 (More evil than good)
	- 5:90-91 (Alcohol is from Satan)
	- 12:36
	- 12:41
	- Tafsir Ibn Kathir (IK) on 2:219-220 says the prohibition was gradual to convince them.
	- Three step prohibition
		- 1. Discourage (2)
		- 2. Don't do prayers (4)
		- 3. Full prohibition (5)
		- Pre-Prohibition
			- 12 (discourage?), 16; and 47 (after 2)

- Semen is pure
	- Aisha used to scrape off dried semen (Muslim: 288, in Chapter 32 (Ruling on Semen))
	- She used to wash semen off his dress (Muslim: 289b) (Bukhari:229-232 (Chapter 64 (see title), 65 (see title)))
	- If it was dried, I'd scrape it off my nails, and if it was wet, I'd wash it (Muslim: 290)
	- They say, for menstrual blood, it had to be washed (Muslim: 291, Bukhari: 277)
		- So semen, unlike menstrual blood is pure.
	- Ibn al-Qayyim in "Badaʾi al-Fawaʾid":
		- Excrement like Suptum, Mucus and Sweat are pure
		- Semen is pure because it's unlike urine and faeces

Some Tafsirs are based on r'ai (opinion) and delve into "dangerous" areas like philosophy and exaggerations in trying to read between the lines, which causes some Mufassirun to abandon certain narrations. e.g. al-Razi's Tafsir (it was said: "It contains anything but Tafsir". But it had interesting explanations.)

- Nikah Mutah was banned by Sunni, not Shia

- Word of God cannot be corrupted
	- 3:4 (Bible and Torah are the word of God)
	- 18:27, 6:115 (The word of God cannot be corrupted)
	- Of course, when it comes to Quran, it's context.

- Muslims believe God is so pure that he cannot possibly become human.

- Lying is allowed (Taqiyya)
	- Jami at-Tirmidhi 1939 (Saheeh):
		- Asma bint Yazid narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: "it is not lawful to lie except in three cases: 
			- Something the man tells his wife to please her,
			- To lie during war, and
			- To lie in order to bring peace between the people."

# Prayer Mixed Speech

**Stats:**
Paragraphs (I split into): 14

So **Alhamdulillah**, we've moved into a different set up, but I pray that **Allah Subhanu Wa Ta'ala** makes it more beneficial. It's more conducive to, a classroom environment. It is better to have people packed in, and you know hopefully, **Insha Allah Ta'ala**, being regular in some of the classes that we have here. But obviously this is a very unique lecture that we have here tonight. 

It's it's not one that's in response to any sort of emergency. It's actually one that compliments- is meant to compliment the collection that we just released which **has been in the works for months** **(Alhamdulilla Rabbil Aalameen)** on the age of Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** and the name of the collection was "More Than Just A Number".

And the idea was to make sure that we don't only contextualize the age of Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** in broader context, using an interdisciplinary approach as did Asadullah along with Dr. Brown, or looking at you know, what the definition of a child has been and is today and will be in the future, but instead to actually reclaim the entire narrative about Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha**.

And I've told this story in the past before, about you know an incident that I had with a woman at University of Florida who could not come to terms or grapple with this particular issue of the age of Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha**. But Allah **Subhanu Wa Ta'ala** blessed her through knowing the person of Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** and had to actually come to Islam through that knowledge of Aisha as a person and actually to name her daughter Aisha once she gave birth to Aisha.

Because one thing if you just pay very close attention to if you attend Jamar Al Tubaz(?), if you attend Islamic lectures, the amount of mentions that Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** gets is more than any woman in the lifetime of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**, and as much as any man in the lifetime of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**.

In fact the last lecture that I gave here, I ended off with a story about Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha**. Because through Aisha we know the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**. Through Aisha we know our religion. Through Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** we developed not just a greater appreciation of love for the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** but we actually develop a greater love and appreciation for her, and she is our mother.

So I want you to first and foremost understand that we're talking about your mom, my mom. She is as beloved to us as our own biological mothers would be. And she is our mother because Allah **Subhanu Wa Ta'ala** gave her that distinction when he gave that distinction to the wives of the messenger **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**. And she is our mother, and that she is the access, that had we not had, we would not know our religion in the way that we know our religion today.

Can you imagine how much we'd be deprived from were not for Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** and the wisdom of Allah **Subhanu Wa Ta'ala** in placing a woman like each Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** in the life of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**, and by extension in our lives through her example, and through her entrance into the example of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**.

So where does the debate about the age of Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** come into and it's very interesting, because the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** came sometime fourteen hundred and fifty years ago. All right, so we're talking, you know centuries ago. And over the years there have been different attacks on the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**, and obviously there is an agenda behind the attacks on the Prophet **Peace Be Upon Him**, starting from the time that he lived Himself **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**.

And, as you go through, generation after generation, you see the evolution of those attacks on the person and the character of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**. This particular topic, which is a favorite talking point of **Islamophobes** today, was not just a minor point or a footnote in the talking points of **Islamophobes** over thirteen centuries. It was completely non-existent, meaning you cannot find in the hundreds and hundreds of books of attacks on the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**'s character from Quraysh to the Orientalists, to the to the early European writers on the character of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**, you cannot find a single attack on this particular facet of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**'s life. Not one person takes objection to it.

In fact it is not even an item for discussion within the Islamic tradition itself. There are no lengthy discourses about the age of Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha** that exists from an Imam al-Ghazali or Sheikh ul-Islam ibn Taymiyya (a Hanbali scholar). So both the defense, as well as the discourse, not necessarily in the context of a defense, both of those are contemporary issues that have been brought up. So when we say not only was this not an issue in the time of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam**, in the 7th century, where Quraysh employed every attack they possibly could on the character and the person of the Prophet **Peace Be Upon Him**, it was not an issue until the 21st century.

Yet somehow it's become the favorite talking point to try to portray the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** in a certain way. And there are numerous ways that we could approach the issue. You could approach it and say well look at marriages in the past right. And you could say you could point to how unfair the uniqueness of the critique of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** is in this regard. Because if you took from Christian tradition or Jewish tradition or completely secular tradition, you will find people that were married with much larger age gaps than that of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** and Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha**, including for example those that that believe that Mariam **Alayhi Al-Salaam**, that Mary was married to Joseph, and the age gap being almost twice as much as the age gap between the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** and Aisha **Radi Allahu Ta'ala Anha**, with Maria **Alayhi Al-Salaam** that I'm being in her teens and Joseph being in his 80s, but that not being a discussion, not being an issue to be brought up.

And I remember you know it was interesting to me as I was looking when I first started studying the biographies of people and the time of the Prophet **Salallahu Alayihi Wasallam** as a whole, and I'll never forget something that actually happened with me and it wasn't in the context of an attack or a discourse. I was just reading in the Tabaqat and the Isaba about Abd Allah Ibn Amir ibn Al Aas, **May Allah Be Pleased With Him And His Father**. And it listed Amir ibn Al Aas, and the mother of Abd Allah ibn Amir ibn Al Aas as 12 and 10 when Abd Allah was born. And I went hmm, that must be a typo. Then I realized it wasn't, because I started cross-checking all the sources- like wait, they had twelve-year-old parents back then? Could you imagine, a twelve-year-old walking around with a child, right? A 12 year old man and a 10 year old woman walking around in the (?)? And you'd be like, wait what is this?

That's because human beings looked so decidedly different 1,400 years ago than they do today, right. And **Subhan Allah** you finding Imam Al-Shafi'i **Rahim Allah** talking about, you know a 50 year old grandmother with a 13 year old grandson, and you're just like what's going on here? How is this all evolving? And cases of law that took place at the time and..

# Thought: About Religious People
- Those who want religion are those who are bad
	- They do bad things, and the guilt weighs upon them
	- They seek forgiveness, and they find it from God
	- They again blame the victims again, for not being religious

- Religious people are dumb
- But they also want power
- And power hungry idiots refuse to reason
- So they think, if God is GOD, why should he conform to your reasons?
- They do not think that a creator would be as dumb as them
- So certainly, the God of their religion is created from their own image, of stupidity

- An example they use is, you should not question your parents
- But, question can imply different things
- It is recognized that a parent is the legal caretaker of the child
- But when given an order, asking the question "WHY" can mean two things
- In one sense, a reply would be "because I said so". This is assuming the why is a rebellious question.
- By assuming the question is rebellious when it really isn't, the parent pressures the child later on to be rebellious.
- In another sense, a reply would be, because I want you be like this, and I believe doing so will go against that goal, and therefore, I'm telling you this.
- The difference is that, to this answer, one can further ask whys towards a specific detail of the decision, share ideas and come to a more peaceful understanding.

# Hadiths 2
- Ruling Regarding Hermaphrodites (Chapter 53 of Book of Etiquettes)
	- Sunan Abu Dawud **4928-4931**
		- Do not kill the effeminate man who died his hands and feet with henna, but prayed. Instead expel him. (Da'eef)
		- Expel them from homes
	- Verdict:
		- The hadith on not killing effeminate men is weak
		- But that on expulsion of hermaphrodites, effeminate men and tomboys are Saheeh.
		- So effeminate men are not safe.
		- Hermaphrodites are said to be cursed.
		- All of them are to be expelled.
		- Tomboy can mean any woman who questions authority, or works jobs.

- Chapter 54 of Book of Etiquettes is about Aisha playing with dolls (which are forbidden for adults)
- Chapter 55 is about Aisha called for consummation of marriage, while playing with swings

- Playing with pigeons is Satanic
	- Sunan Abu Dawud **4940**: Messenger of Allah saw a man chasing a  pigeon and he said: “A devil chasing a she-devil.” (Hasan)

- Quran 4:117 (Surah An-Nisa)
	- Hatred of female gods explicitly as idols (MY BAD)

- Instead of improving from history, these idiots follow it.


- Dirty well water is holy (Zam Zam)

# Proverbs
- When Muslims are a minority, they want minority rights. When they are a majority, there are no minority rights.
- When Islam is criticized in Islamic countries, it's blasphemy. When it is criticized in non-Islamic countries, it's Islamophobia.

- What the hell is the left doing?

- Sarah Haider (ex-Muslim)
	- Islam is a sexist religion
	- Islam is very political



- **What Muslims see:** They are a bunch of mu'tazillas (deviants according to Sunnis). Islam is perfect, Muslims are not.
	- **What we see:** Bunch of crazy followers of Mohammed
	- **What are Mu'tazillas, and why do Sunnis reject them?:**
		- Orthodox Sunnis believe the Quran is the uncreated word of Allah and is co-eternal with Allah.
		- Mu'tazillas believe that since Quran is the word of Allah, it was created later by Allah.
	- **What we see:** Their own political or theological disagreements keep them divided, and their insistence on theocracy makes it a problem for all others, while each of them say that "the problem is not us, but them".
		- They think if you really knew Allah, you wouldn't have a complaint with their version of Islam.
		- They do not think that human lives have intrinsic value, and they believe that when they die, the true believers will go to Allah, so death is not that big of a deal for them compared to their faith.
		- In essence, they are a death cult, and they expect the others to share the same perspectives.

- Analogy: consider a cult that sacrifices children
	- We only have a problem with child sacrifice
	- So we would want you to renounce child sacrifices
	- But if you say child sacrifice is part of our religion, then we have no choice but to criticize the whole religion
	- But our focus is always on the child sacrifice part
	- We do not care if you do a 1000 good things, that is no justification for you to do evil
	- Other people may not do 1000 good things, but they don't do evil either
	- At least, those who do evil would be doing evil, not doing it in the name of God

- Strategy
	- Educate Muslims on Islam
		- The four sources of Shari'ah
		- The type of people
		- The types of texts
	- Start with logical fallacies
	- Then demonstrate evils
	- Then fill up other logical fallacies

- Extras
	- Point out we hate Islam (the idea), not Muslims (the humans)
	- Point out that when we talk about Mohammed's marriage with Aisha, we do not want to shame him, we just want to point out it was a medieval practice, not ideal for today's world. There is no element of shame, but rather, it is a practice that has bad consequences.

- Likelihood of children hitting puberty early is less due to lack of nutrition

- Just think of it, if someone else went through such levels of gymnastics to point at the truth, what would you think of them? There could be truth in case of one event, but several such instances? And that, while the effects of it continue to happen from other people who claim to be on the same cause?


- Ramadan feasting

- **Claim:** Do you work focused on reward? No, you work with the promise of a reward.
	- **My claim:** No, you work because you want to make the world according to our desires.
		- **You are paid when you work to build the world according to someone else's plans.**
		- If you're working for your plans, you will have to spend effort from your side.
		- **After all, money is just "Proof of Work". Proof, for what?**
		- If people were doing their own part for the community, currency would be unnecessary.
		- **Of course, it is necessary assuming some people are lazy.**
		- But the truth is, what seems lazy to some people is not always the same thing.
		- Artists may seem lazy to other people, but in reality, their minds are just less cloudy.
		- And the society needs both artists and developers.
		- **Also, it is forgotten that with automation, many forms of work will be replaced.**
		- But with religion, one is not motivated to think in this manner, as you will be rewarded in paradise.
		- As for non-religious people, their reward is the fruit of their labour, how they shape the world.
		- Of course, one may be cheated upon. But much of that is part of God's tests.
			- Surely, you did not suffer as much as many others who you see suffering.
			- And many a times, the people who virtue signal cry more than the people they say are suffering.
			- Many people have suffered in life, but virtue signalers don't think that they've gone through that too.
			- They press people to give up their comforts, without giving them a reason to do so.
			- Everyone really wants to live in a world of adventure, not live minimally.
			- But the virtue signalers take on the world's suffering and discard their humanity.
			- In discarding their humanity, and being machine like, they become unrelatable to other humans.
			- So everyone hates them, because they think they've become dull by pretending to be morally superior.
		- My point is that, if you make the world a better place, paradise is in of itself.
			- But of course, religious people have come up with various explanations to hate the "world"
				- Example: "Satan controls the world", "The world is a test"
				- The primary reason for this is, they needed some way to explain away unreasonable sorrows
				- They can't trust how God would want to test us if there was no heaven afterwards
				- And they can't trust the atheist explanation of "it is like that" (even I agree with that)
				- 



- Ithna ‘Asharis (Twelvers) / Rafidis (Rejectors, of the caliphs) / Imamis
	- The term Rafidis used for Shias in general, although only Twelvers are the ones who denied the caliphs
	- Sunnis say they use Taqiyya to outwards pretend as Muslims, while inwardly being something else (lol)
	- Sunnis say, because they called the Sahabah kafirs, they imply that the Quran is altered, and hence, curse it
	- So Shias are seen as a greater threat to Islam than anyone else.



- Mohammed was white

- Thighing

# Speech Analysis

- How Quran influences Muslim attitudes
	- They are misguided by Satan
	- Disbelievers are all clearly hypocrites

- Islam is the most logical religion
	- You think you invented Tawhid?
	- Monotheism is known to everyone (except Greeks, etc - but even Aristotle knew it.)
	- Also, just because you say one true / potentially true thing, that doesn't make everything else true.
	- I could say you should put your soap in your cupboard.
		- It is reasonable. No logical flaws in it.
		- But does that mean those who leave it in the bathroom are wrong? No
		- This is the stupidity of the Muslims
