The weavers, the webs.

The myth of Arachnae was an attempt to show the relationship between art and tyrannical power. At the time, weaving was a common metaphor for poetry.

The Mundaka Upanishad also gives the analogy of the spider and the web, alongside the emergence of herbs from the earth and hair from the human body to describe reality.
