# Lies that Muslims say
- Killing a person is as though killing all humanity (covered in problems section)
	- Except for spreading mischief
- Whoever hurts a Dhimmi hurts me
- To me your way, to you yours
	- This was a Meccan verse
	- This was a plea to leave the Muslims alone
	- This was also a sign of disrespect - as how it was stated without "I will not follow your way"
	- Mohammed was tolerated as someone who claims to be a divine messenger, until he insulted their history

- We only have to fight oppressors
	- As per 9:5, the blood of disbelievers is lawful by default
	- Exceptions: Fixed-term treaties, Strategic Ceasefires, Dhimmah, Mu'ustamin

- Acting according to weak Hadiths is fine
- Weak Hadiths are often used in Da'wah

- Muruna
	- Start with: Quran 2:225, 3:28, 3:54, 8:30, 9:3, 10:21, 16:106, and 66:2
	- Sahih Bukhari 3:45:687, 4:52:270, 4:52:271, 50:369, 52:269, and 84:64
	- Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 803
	- Ibn Ishaq 834, 837, 981
	- and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, vol. 4 (Surat 7-10)
	  
	  These cover such topics as deceiving non-Muslims, faking friendship with non-Muslims, not keeping their word to non-Muslims, lying about their faith to non-Muslims, violating treaties with non-Muslims, tricking non-Muslims into letting their guard down and then slaughtering them, and the reputation early Muslims had for lying.
	  
	  **Fatawa Islamiyah** might also be a good resource. I haven't gone through those in a long time but try vols. 6 & 8.
