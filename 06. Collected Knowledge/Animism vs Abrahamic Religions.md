## Lingam
Actually the words in Sanskrit are Lingam (Pullingam and Streelingam).

Shishinam is the word for penis.
Yoni never comes into play.

Lingam means symbol.
The Shiva Lingam consists of the Pullingam and the Pitham (Source).

Lingam is used to refer to Shiva as the generator, and Yoni is used to refer to Shakthi as the womb (as Jagat-Yoni), but the analogies are different from the material world, as they are formless and not the same as the human body. In other words, the divine

**Ithihasas:**
- Mahabharata Adi Parva Chapter 95 (Pandu killed a Rishi who was having mating in the form of a deer)

	- Claim: Aswamedha is a ritual in which a horse is killed, and the queen will insert it's penis into her vagina, and say horse, give seed.

# Regarding Critics
- Hindus generally consider their religion as myths
- Apologists try to find problems in texts that Hindus don't even read
	- For example, the Manu Smriti is no Bible - it is at most like a Sharia text
- Hindus put their brains first, and religion second
	- That is, they are not afraid to think beyond their religion if someone gives them a good enough argument
	- Because "disbelief" is not a crime
- They use misinterpretations to find flaws in a culture that they don't understand
	- So much so that even where there are no problems, then find problems
