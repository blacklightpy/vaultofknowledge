Padma Puraana claims a lot of things for the Vaishnava sect, such as:

- Vishnu asked Shiva to be born as Shankara to write false scriptures to gain converts (from Buddhism).
- Shiva was created by Vishnu
- Shiva Purana is Tamsik and leads you to hell.

But Padma Purana itself refutes this by saying all Puraanas are the right arm of Hari.
