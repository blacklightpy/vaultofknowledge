As I've come to think of it lately, atheists are united only on the basis
of their hatred of religions. This I covered elsewhere.

My point here is different.

Firstly, I was done with the atheist communities after seeing how obtuse
they are. Being an agnostic atheist myself, I've had some humility in saying
that I did not know, before I became a theist. But atheist communities,
especially on Reddit, are not like this at all. Well, I guess, how did I even
expect Redditors of all people to be rational, much less an atheist community?
Well, it's one thing about the way in which I was led to theism, and it makes
you want to see the good in all people. But then, there was also the aspect of
how when I was an atheist, I used to be rational.

I guess this is why Hindus often say that if you are an atheist, be like an
Indian atheist as opposed to a Western atheist. Because Western atheism is a
counterpart of the Western dogmatic theism. But anyways, when Western culture
was imported to everywhere, so did their theism and atheism influence theist
and atheist attitudes in India.

Anyways, back to the point.
