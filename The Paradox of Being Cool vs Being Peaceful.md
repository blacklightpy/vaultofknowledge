If you want to be cool, you'll have to stand out by having something special that others do not. This means that you should have some proprietary secret or a skill.

But if you want to be at peace, that means you must share your technologies.

So the way to be at peace and still be cool is to ensure that everyone has high standards of living, and for you to drop your ego. Without high standards of living, no one is cool, but with it, everyone has the option to drop their ego and realize true peace.
