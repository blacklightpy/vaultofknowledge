+ That is, not all knowledge comes from random accidents that get documented. Conscious intuition plays a big role.

That is, what the mind intuits is meaningful, and that's not just because everything that happens does so due to material phenomena, and the intellect too is such a material phenomena. That all things are material is also affirmed by Hindu theology, but what's material comes from the efficient and material cause that is Brahman.

That is why when you identify something, you feel good. It is not just because that's evolutionary good, because people who are ascetic or less inclined to activities that are reproductionarily or evolutionarily beneficiary still have these qualities. Well, they are evolutionarily benefeciary in the mental sense, not of the material world. That is because the goalless material world has no will to govern itself towards evolution.

Atheists criticizing Hindu theology is like them criticizing High School Science for being incorrect. High School science is presented that way because complex concepts cannot be directly conveyed, and so instead, a limited explanation is given through which one may be guided to the complete truth later.
