I think the movie says it is from Garuda Puraana, but I found that it is from The Puranic Encyclopaedia by Vettam Mani. The list of hells is in the Story of Kaala (Yama).

https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241667.html

Now, many sources disagree on whether there are 21 or 28 hells. They are sourced in Shreemad Bhaagavatham (28 hells), Vishnu Puraana (28 hells), Devi Bhaagavatham (28 hells), Manu Smrithi (21 hells), Yaajnavalkya Smrithi (21 hells). But these three Puraanas end up stating there are hundreds of thousands of hells. Garuda Puraana also states that there are 84 lakh hells, but 21 are the worst.

**Shreemad Bhaagavatham, Canto 5 (The Creative Impetus), Chapter 26 (A Description of the Hellish Planets), Verse 7:**

> Some authorities say that there is a total of twenty-one hellish planets, and some say twenty-eight. My dear King, I shall outline all of them according to their names, forms and symptoms. The names of the different hells are as follows: Tāmisra, Andhatāmisra, Raurava, Mahāraurava, Kumbhīpāka, Kālasūtra, Asipatravana, Sūkaramukha, Andhakūpa, Kṛmibhojana, Sandaṁśa, Taptasūrmi, Vajrakaṇṭaka-śālmalī, Vaitaraṇī, Pūyoda, Prāṇarodha, Viśasana, Lālābhakṣa, Sārameyādana, Avīci, Ayaḥpāna, Kṣārakardama, Rakṣogaṇa-bhojana, Śūlaprota, Dandaśūka, Avaṭa-nirodhana, Paryāvartana and Sūcīmukha. All these planets are meant for punishing the living entities.

**Vishnu Puraana Book 2, Chapter 6:**

> PARÁŚARA.--I will now, great Muni, give you an account of the hells which are situated beneath the earth and beneath the waters, and into which sinners are finally sent.

These and many other fearful hells are the awful provinces of the kingdom of Yama, terrible with instruments of torture and with fire; into which are hurled all those who are addicted when alive to sinful practices.
